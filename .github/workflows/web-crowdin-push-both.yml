name: "Push Crowdin translations (web)"

# This is a variant of web-crowdin-sync.yml that uploads the translated strings in
# addition to the source strings.
#
# This allows us to change the strings in our source code for an automated
# refactoring (e.g. renaming a key), and then run this workflow to update the
# data in Crowdin taking our source code as the source of truth.

    # Trigger manually, or using
    # `gh workflow run web-crowdin-push-both.yml --ref <my-branch>`
