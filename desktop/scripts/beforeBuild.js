/**
 * This hook is invoked during the initial build (e.g. when triggered by "yarn
 * build"), and importantly, on each rebuild for a different architecture during
 * the build. We use it to ensure that the vips binary is for the current
 * architecture being built. See "[Note: vips]" for more details.
 *
 * The documentation for this hook is at:
 * https://www.electron.build/app-builder-lib.interface.configuration#beforebuild
 *
 * > The function to be run before dependencies are installed or rebuilt.
 *
 * Here is an example of the context that it gets
 * https://www.electron.build/app-builder-lib.interface.beforebuildcontext
 *
 *     appDir: '/path/to/ente/desktop',
 *     platform: Platform {
 *         name: 'mac',
 *         buildConfigurationKey: 'mac',
 *         nodeName: 'darwin'
 *     },
 *     arch: 'arm64'
 *
 *  Note that we must not return falsey from this function, because:
 *
 *  > Resolving to false will skip dependencies install or rebuild.
