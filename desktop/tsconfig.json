        /* Recommended target, lib and other settings for code running in the
           version of Node.js bundled with Electron.

           Currently, with Electron 29, this is Node.js 20.9
           https://www.electronjs.org/blog/electron-29-0

           Note that we cannot do

               "extends": "@tsconfig/node20/tsconfig.json",

           because that sets "lib": ["es2023"]. However (and I don't fully
           understand what's going on here), that breaks our compilation since
           tsc can then not find type definitions of things like ReadableStream.

           Adding "dom" to "lib" (e.g. `"lib": ["es2023", "dom"]`) fixes the
           issue, but that doesn't sound correct - the main Electron process
           isn't running in a browser context.

           It is possible that we're using some of the types incorrectly. For
           now, we just omit the "lib" definition and rely on the defaults for
           the "target" we've chosen. This is also what the current
           electron-forge starter does:

               yarn create electron-app electron-forge-starter -- --template=webpack-typescript

           Enhancement: Can revisit this later.
