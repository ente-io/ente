## Electron

[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) is a cross-platform (Linux, Windows,
macOS) way for creating desktop apps using TypeScript.

Electron embeds Chromium and Node.js in the generated app's binary. The
generated app thus consists of two separate processes - the _main_ process, and
a _renderer_ process.

- The _main_ process runs the embedded node. This process can deal with the host
  OS - it is conceptually like a `node` repl running on your machine. In our
  case, the TypeScript code (in the `src/` directory) gets transpiled by `tsc`
  into JavaScript in the `build/app/` directory, which gets bundled in the
  generated app's binary and is loaded by the node (main) process when the app
  starts.

- The _renderer_ process is a regular web app that gets loaded into the embedded
  Chromium. When the main process starts, it creates a new "window" that shows
  this embedded Chromium. In our case, we build and bundle a static export of
  the [Photos web app](../../web/README.md) in the generated desktop app. This
  gets loaded by the embedded Chromium at runtime, acting as the desktop app's
  UI.

There is also a third environment that gets temporarily created:

- The [preload script](../src/preload.ts) acts as a gateway between the _main_
  and the _renderer_ process. It runs in its own isolated environment.

### Packaging

[Electron Builder](https://www.electron.build) is used for packaging the app for
distribution.

During the build it uses
[electron-builder-notarize](https://github.com/karaggeorge/electron-builder-notarize)
to notarize the macOS binary.

### Updates

[electron-updater](https://www.electron.build/auto-update#debugging), while a
separate package, is also a part of Electron Builder. It provides an alternative
to Electron's built in auto updater, with a more flexible API. It supports auto
updates for the DMG, AppImage, DEB, RPM and NSIS packages.

[compare-versions](https://github.com/omichelsen/compare-versions) is used for
semver comparisons when we decide when to trigger updates.

### Logging

[electron-log](https://github.com/megahertz/electron-log) is used for logging.
Specifically, it allows us to log to a file (in addition to the console of the
Node.js process), and also handles log rotation and limiting the size of the log
files.

### next-electron-server

This spins up a server for serving files using a protocol handler inside our
Electron process. This allows us to directly use the output produced by
`next build` for loading into our renderer process.

### Others

- [any-shell-escape](https://github.com/boazy/any-shell-escape) is for escaping
  shell commands before we execute them (e.g. say when invoking the embedded
  ffmpeg CLI).

- [auto-launch](https://github.com/Teamwork/node-auto-launch) is for
  automatically starting our app on login, if the user so wishes.

- [electron-store](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-store) is used for
  persisting user preferences and other arbitrary data.

## Dev

See [web/docs/dependencies#dev](../../web/docs/dependencies.md#dev) for the
general development experience related dependencies like TypeScript etc, which
are similar to that in the web code.

Some extra ones specific to the code here are:

- [@tsconfig/recommended](https://github.com/tsconfig/bases) gives us a base
  tsconfig for the Node.js version that our current Electron version uses.

- [shx](https://github.com/shelljs/shx) provides us a portable way to use Unix
  commands in our `package.json` scripts. This allows us to use the same
  commands (like `ln`) across both POSIX platforms (Linux, macOS) and Windows.

- [cross-env](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env) is similar to shx, but
  for allowing us to set environment variables in a way that also works on
  Windows.

- We don't need `ajv`, but it is a transitive dependency which breaks the build
  if we let its version be resolved via the yarn resolution mechanism. Taking a
  direct dependency on it is the easiest workaround for now.

## Functionality

### Format conversion

For video conversions and metadata extraction, we use ffmpeg. To bundle a
(platform specific) static binary of ffmpeg with our app, we use
[ffmpeg-static](https://github.com/eugeneware/ffmpeg-static).

> There is a significant (~20x) speed difference between using the compiled
> FFmpeg binary and using the Wasm one (that our renderer process already has).
> Which is why we bundle it to speed up operations on the desktop app.

On Linux and Windows, we use `vips` for thumbnail generation and JPEG conversion
of unpreviewable images. A static OS/architecture specific binary of this is
bundled in our extra resources (`build`) folder by `scripts/vips.sh` and/or
`scripts/beforeBuild.js`. See "[Note: vips]" for more details.

On macOS, we use the `sips` CLI tool for these tasks, but that is already
available on the host machine, and is not bundled with our app.

### ML

[onnxruntime-node](https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime) is used as the ML
runtime. It powers both natural language searches (using CLIP) and face
detection (using YOLO).

[clip-bpe-js](https://github.com/simonwarchol/clip-bpe-js) is used for tokening
the user's search phrase before computing its CLIP (text) embedding.

### ZIP

[node-stream-zip](https://github.com/antelle/node-stream-zip) is used for
reading of large ZIP files (e.g. during imports of Google Takeout ZIPs).

[lru-cache](https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache) is used to cache file ZIP
handles to avoid reopening them for every operation.

### Watch folders

[chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) is used as a file system
watcher for the watch folders functionality.
