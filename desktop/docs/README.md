# Developer docs

If you just want to run the Ente Photos desktop app locally or develop it, you
can do:

    yarn install
    yarn dev

The docs in this directory provide more details that some developers might find
useful. You might also find the developer docs for
[web](../../web/docs/README.md) useful.
