 * Allow uploads to arbitrary S3 buckets.
 *
 * The embedded web app within in the desktop app is served over the ente://
 * protocol. When pages in that web app make requests, their originate from this
 * "ente://app" origin, which thus serves as the value for the
 * "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header in the CORS preflight requests.
 *
 * Some S3 providers (B2 is the motivating example for this workaround) do not
 * allow whitelisting custom URI schemes. That is, even if we set
 * "`allowedOrigin: ["*"]` in our B2 bucket CORS configuration, when the web
 * code makes a CORS request with ACAO "ente://app", it gets back
 * "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" set to `null` in the response, and thus the
 * request fails (since it does not match the origin we sent).
 *
 * This is not an issue for production apps since they fetches or uploads via a
 * worker instead of directly touching an S3 provider.
 *
 * This is not also an issue for fetches in the self hosted apps since those
 * involve a redirection, and during a redirection Chromium sets the ACAO in the
 * request to `null` (this is the correct behaviour as per the spec, for more
 * details See: [Note: Passing credentials for self-hosted file fetches]).
 *
 * But this is an issue for uploads in the self hosted apps (or when we
 * ourselves are trying to test things by with an arbitrary S3 bucket without
 * going via a worker). During upload, there is no redirection, so the request
 * ACAO is "ente://app" but the response ACAO is `null` which don't match,
 * causing the request to fail.
 *
 * As a workaround, we intercept the ACAO header and set it to `*`.
 *
 * However, an unconditional interception causes problems with requests that use
 * credentials, since "*" is not a valid value in such cases. One such example
 * is the HCaptcha requests made by Stripe when we initiate a payment within the
 * desktop app:
 *
 * > Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://api2.hcaptcha.com/getcaptcha/xxx' from
 * > origin 'https://newassets.hcaptcha.com' has been blocked by CORS policy:
 * > The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header in the response must
 * > not be the wildcard '*' when the request's credentials mode is 'include'.
 * > The credentials mode of requests initiated by the XMLHttpRequest is
 * > controlled by the withCredentials attribute.
 *
 * So we only do this workaround if there was either no ACAO specified in the
 * response, or if the ACAO in the response was "null" (the string serialization
 * of `null`).
