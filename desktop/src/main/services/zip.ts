 * To clear the cache (which is a good idea to avoid having open file handles
 * lying around), use {@link clearOpenZipCache}.
 *
 * Why was this needed
 * -------------------
 *
 * Caching the StreamZip file handles _significantly_ (hours => seconds)
 * improves the performance of the metadata parsing step during import of large
 * Google Takeout zips.
 *
 * In ad-hoc tests, it seems that beyond a certain zip size (few GBs), reopening
 * the handle to a stream zip overshadows the time taken to read the individual
 * JSONs.
