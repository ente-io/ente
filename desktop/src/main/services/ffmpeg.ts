 * Run a FFmpeg command
 *
 * [Note: FFmpeg in Electron]
 *
 * There is a Wasm build of FFmpeg, but that is currently 10-20 times slower
 * that the native build. That is slow enough to be unusable for our purposes.
 * https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/docs/performance
 *
 * So the alternative is to bundle a FFmpeg executable binary with our app. e.g.
 *
 *     yarn add fluent-ffmpeg ffmpeg-static ffprobe-static
 *
 * (we only use ffmpeg-static, the rest are mentioned for completeness' sake).
 *
 * Interestingly, Electron already bundles an binary FFmpeg library (it comes
 * from the ffmpeg fork maintained by Chromium).
 * https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/third_party/ffmpeg
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53963672/what-version-of-ffmpeg-is-bundled-inside-electron
 *
 * This can be found in (e.g. on macOS) at
 *
 *     $ file ente.app/Contents/Frameworks/Electron\ Framework.framework/Versions/Current/Libraries/libffmpeg.dylib
 *     .../libffmpeg.dylib: Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64
 *
 * But I'm not sure if our code is supposed to be able to use it, and how.

    //    displaymatrix` in the ffmpeg output) that Chrome (and thus Electron)
    //    doesn't take into account, so these play upside down.

    const rescaleVideo = !(bitrate && bitrate <= 2000 * 1000);

    // [Note: Tonemapping HDR to HD]
    //
    // BT.709 ("HD") is a standard that describes things like how color is
    // encoded, the range of values, and their "meaning" - i.e. how to map the
    // values in the video to the pixels on the screen.
    //
    // It is not the only such standard, there are three common examples:
    //
    // - BT.601 ("Standard-Definition" or SD)
    // - BT.709 ("High-Definition" or HD)
    // - BT.2020 ("Ultra-High-Definition" or UHD, aka HDR^).
    //
    // ^ HDR ("High-Dynamic-Range") is an addendum to BT.2020, but for our
    //   purpose here we can treat it as as alias.
    //
    // BT.709 is the most common amongst these for older files out stored on
    // computers, and they conform mostly to the standard (one notable exception
    // is that the BT.709 standard also recommends using the yuv422p pixel
    // format, but de facto yuv420p is used because many video players only
    // support yuv420p).
    //
    // Since BT.709 is the most widely supported standard, we use it when
    // generating the HLS playlist so to allow playback across the widest
    // possible hardware/OS/browser combinations.
    //
    // If we convert HDR to HD without naively, then the colors look washed out
    // compared to the original. To resolve this, we use a ffmpeg filterchain
    // that uses the tonemap filter.
    //
    // However applying this tonemap to videos that are already HD leads to a
    // brightness drop. So we conditionally apply this filter chain only if the
    // colorspace is not already BT.709.
    //
    // See also: [Note: Alternative FFmpeg command for HDR videos], although
    // that uses a allow-list based check (while here we use deny-list).

    // name "output.m3u8".

    // ffmpeg will automatically place the segments in a file with the same base

/**
 * Heuristically detect if the file at given path is a HDR video.

 * allow-list instead, and considers any file with color transfer "smpte2084" or
 * "arib-std-b67" to be HDR. While this is in some sense a more exact check, it
 * comes with different caveats:
 *
 * - These particular constants are not guaranteed to be correct; these are just
 *   what I saw on the internet as being used / recommended for detecting HDR.
 *
 * - Since we don't have ffprobe, we're not checking the color space value
 *   itself but a substring of the stream line in the ffmpeg stderr output.
 *
 * In particular, we use this more exact check for places where we have less
 * leeway. e.g. when generating thumbnails, if we apply the tonemapping to any
 * non-BT.709 file (as the HLS stream generation does), we start getting the
 * "code 3074: no path between colorspaces" error during the JPEG conversion
 * (this is not a problem in the H.264 conversion).
 *
 * - See: [Note: Alternative FFmpeg command for HDR videos]
 * - See: [Note: Tonemapping HDR to HD]
 *
 * @param inputFilePath The path to a video file on the user's machine.
 *
 * @returns `true` if this file is likely a HDR video. Exceptions are treated as
 * `false` to make this function safe to invoke without breaking the happy path.
