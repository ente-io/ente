Fully open source end-to-end encrypted photos, authenticators and more.

# Ente

Ente is a service that provides a fully open source, end-to-end encrypted
platform for you to store your data in the cloud without needing to trust the
service provider. On top of this platform, we have built two apps so far: Ente
Photos (an alternative to Apple and Google Photos) and Ente Auth (a 2FA
alternative to the deprecated Authy).

This monorepo contains all our source code - the client apps (iOS / Android /
F-Droid / Web / Linux / macOS / Windows) for both the products (and more planned
future ones!), and the server that powers them.

Our source code and cryptography have been externally audited by Cure53 (a
German cybersecurity firm, arguably the world's best), Symbolic Software (French
cryptography experts) and Fallible (an Indian penetration testing firm).

## Ente Photos

Our flagship product. 3x data replication. On device machine learning. Cross
platform. Private sharing. Collaborative albums. Family plans. Easy import,
easier export. Background uploads. The list goes on. And of course, all of this,
while being fully end-to-end encrypted.

Ente Photos is a paid service, but we offer a free trial. You can also clone
this repository and choose to self host.

## Ente Auth

![Screenshots of Ente Photos](.github/assets/auth.png)

Our labour of love. Two years ago, while building Ente Photos, we realized that
there was no open source end-to-end encrypted authenticator app. We already had
the building blocks, so we built one.

Ente Auth is currently free. If in the future we convert this to a paid service,
existing users will be grandfathered in.
