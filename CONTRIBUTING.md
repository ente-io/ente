## Spread the word

**This is the most impactful contribution you can make**.

[Spread the word](https://help.ente.io/photos/features/referral-program/). Online on your favorite social media channels. Offline to your friends and family who are looking for a privacy-friendly alternative to big tech.

## Engage with the community

Just hang around, enjoy the vibe. The Ente community — the people who are building Ente, and the people who are using Ente — hang out at various places depending on their proclivity:

- [Discord](https://discord.ente.io)
- [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ente)
- [X / Twitter](https://twitter.com/enteio)
- [Github Discussions](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions)

Just being around might seem a small thing, but it provides us energy. Knowing that there is a community of people who care for what we are building, **who want us to do better**.

## Translate

Visit our Crowdin projects to help with translations:

If your language is not listed for translation, please [create a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/issues/new?title=Request+for+New+Language+Translation&body=Language+name%3A+%0AProject%3A+auth%2Fphotos%2Fboth)
to have it added. It is okay to have partial translations. Once ~90% of the
strings in a language get translated, we will start surfacing it in the apps.

## Document

The help guides and FAQs for users of Ente products are also open source, and
can be edited in a wiki-esque manner by our community members. More than the
quantity, we feel this helps improve the quality and approachability of the
documentation by bringing in more diverse viewpoints and familiarity levels.

See [docs/](docs/README.md) for how to edit these documents.

## Code contributions

If you'd like to contribute code, it is best to start small. Consider some well-scoped changes, say like adding more [custom icons to auth](mobile/apps/auth/docs/adding-icons.md), or fixing a specific bug.

Code that changes the behaviour of the product might not get merged, at least not initially. The PR can serve as a discussion bed, but you might find it easier to just start a discussion instead, or post your perspective in the (likely) existing thread about the behaviour change or new feature you wish for.
