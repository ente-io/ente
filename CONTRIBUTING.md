# Contributing

First and foremost, thank you for your interest in contributing to Ente 🙏

There are many ways to contribute, and most of them don't require writing code.

* [Spread the word](#spread-the-word)
* [Engage with the community](#engage-with-the-community)
* [Translate](#translate)
* [Document](#document)


## Spread the word

This is perhaps the most impactful contribution you can make. [Spread the
word](https://help.ente.io/photos/features/referral-program/). Online on your
favorite social media channels. Offline to your friends and family who are
looking for a privacy-friendly alternative to big tech.

## Engage with the community

Just hang around, enjoy the vibe. Answer someone's query on our
[Discord](https://discord.gg/z2YVKkycX3), or pile on in the sporadic #off-topic
rants there. Chuckle (or wince!) at our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/enteio)
memes. Suggest a new feature in our [Github
Discussions](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/new?category=feature-requests),
or upvote the existing ones that you feel we should focus on first. Provide your
opinion on existing threads.

These might seem like small things, but it provides us energy. Knowing that
there is a community of people who care for what we are building.

## Translate

If you're interested in helping out with translation, please visit our Crowdin
projects to get started:

| Project  |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Auth](https://crowdin.com/project/ente-authenticator-app)  | [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/ente-authenticator-app/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/ente-authenticator-app)  |
| [Photos](https://crowdin.com/project/ente-photos-app)  | [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/ente-photos-app/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/ente-photos-app)  |
| [Photos Web / Desktop](https://crowdin.com/project/ente-photos-web)  | [![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/ente-photos-web/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/ente-photos-web)  |


If your language is not listed for translation, please [create a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/issues/new?title=Request+for+New+Language+Translation&body=Language+name%3A+%0AProject%3A+auth%2Fphotos%2Fboth)
to have it added. It is okay to have partial translations. Once ~90% of the
strings in a language get translated, we will start surfacing it in the apps.

Thank you for your support.

## Document

The help guides and FAQs for users of Ente products are also open source, and
can be edited in a wiki-esque manner by our community members. More than the
quantity, we feel this helps improve the quality and approachability of the
documentation by bringing in more diverse viewpoints and familiarity levels.

See [docs/](docs/README.md) for how to edit these documents.

## Code contributions

Code is a small aspect of community, and the ways mentioned above are more
important in helping us. But if you'd _really_ like to contribute code, it is
best to start small. Consider some well-scoped changes, say like adding more
[custom icons to auth](auth/docs/adding-icons.md).

Each of the individual product/platform specific directories in this repository
have instructions on setting up a dev environment.

For anything beyond trivial bug fixes, please use [features requests and
discussions](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions) instead of performing
code changes directly.

> [!TIP]

> Please remember that code is a important, but small, part of the overall big
> picture that makes a product a joy to use. Something that's easy in code is
> not necessarily the right choice for the product as a whole. So we'll repeat -
> there are other ways to contribute than code that we'd request you to
> consider.
