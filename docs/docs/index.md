# Welcome!

## Introduction

Ente (pronounced en-_tay_) is a end-to-end encrypted platform for privately,
reliably, and securely storing your data on the cloud, over which 2 applications
have been developed and made available for mobile, web and desktop, namely:

- **Ente Photos** - An alternative to Google Photos and Apple Photos
- **Ente Auth** - A free 2FA alternative to Authy

## History

Ente was the founded by Vishnu Mohandas (he's also Ente's CEO) in response to
privacy concerns with major tech companies. The underlying motivation was the
understanding that big tech had no incentive to fix their act, but with
end-to-end encrypted cross platform apps, there was a way for people to take
back control over their own data without sacrificing on features.

### Origin of the name

In Malayalam, Vishnu's native language, "ente" means "mine", thus "Ente Photos"
literally means "my photos".

But one day, he discovered that "ente" means "duck" in German. This unexpected
connection sealed the deal after looking for alternative names and led to the
adoption of ["Ducky"](https://ente.io/blog/ducky/), representing the playfulness
and friendly nature of the community and team.

## Getting Started

We recommend reading the documentation for [Ente Photos](/photos/) or
[Ente Auth](/auth/) to get started with installation on the desired platform,
explore available features and usage.

If you are looking to self-host Ente, we recommend you to read the
[official documentation](/self-hosting/) for updated information on getting
started, installation, administration and maintenance.
