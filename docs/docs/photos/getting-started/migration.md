# Migrate from other services

If you have photos stored in other services or on your devices, Ente makes it easy to import them.

> **Note**: This step is **optional**. If you're starting fresh with Ente and don't have existing photos to import, you can skip this step and proceed directly to [set up for daily use](/photos/getting-started/daily-use).

This guide will help you choose the right migration method for your situation.

## Which method should I use?

### Migrating from cloud services

If your photos are currently stored in another cloud service, we have detailed guides for the most popular platforms:

- **[From Google Photos](/photos/migration/from-google-photos/)** - Import your Google Photos library using Google Takeout
- **[From Apple Photos](/photos/migration/from-apple-photos/)** - Import from iCloud Photos or your Mac's Photos app
- **[From Amazon Photos](/photos/migration/from-amazon-photos)** - Import your Amazon Photos library

### Migrating from local storage

If your photos are stored on your computer or external hard drive:

- **[From local hard disk](/photos/migration/from-local-hard-disk)** - Import photos from folders on your computer or external drives

## How migration works

All migration methods work by importing your photos into Ente while preserving:

- Original photo quality (no compression)
- Creation dates and timestamps
- Folder/album organization (when possible)
- Photo metadata

The migration process is safe - your original photos remain untouched in their current location until you decide to delete them.

**What to expect:**

- **Time**: Large photo libraries can take several hours to days to fully import, depending on your library size and internet speed
- **Storage**: Ensure you have enough storage space in your Ente plan before starting
- **Duplicates**: Ente automatically detects and handles duplicate photos during import

## Tips for a smooth migration

1. **Start with a small batch** - Try importing a small folder first to familiarize yourself with the process
2. **Check your storage** - Make sure you have enough storage space in your Ente plan for all your photos
3. **Use desktop for large libraries** - The desktop app is faster for importing large photo collections
4. **Keep originals until verified** - Don't delete your original photos until you've confirmed everything imported correctly
