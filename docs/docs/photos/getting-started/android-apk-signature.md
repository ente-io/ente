# Verify the Ente Photos Android APK

If you downloaded the Ente Photos APK directly from our GitHub releases, you can
verify that it was signed with Ente's expected signing certificate.

These fingerprints are for the direct APK download. Play Store and F-Droid
packages may use different signing keys.

## Certificate fingerprints

- **SHA1**: E1:60:10:18:B6:B0:2E:A3:74:6F:90:67:50:30:29:75:0E:EF:6D:39
- **SHA256**: 35:ED:56:81:B7:0B:B3:BD:35:D9:0D:85:6A:F5:69:4C:50:4D:EF:46:AA:D8:3F:77:7B:1C:67:5C:F4:51:35:0B

## Verify the APK

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs <path_to_apk>
```

Compare the `SHA1` or `SHA256` value printed by `apksigner` with the
fingerprints above.
