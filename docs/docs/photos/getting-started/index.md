# Getting Started

Welcome to Ente Photos! Ente Photos is an end-to-end encrypted alternative to Google Photos and Apple Photos, designed to keep your photos private while making them easily accessible across all your devices.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started, from installation to daily use. Follow these steps in order for the smoothest onboarding experience:

## 1. Installation

Download and install Ente Photos on your mobile and desktop devices. Available for iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Learn more in the [Installation guide](/photos/getting-started/installation).

## 2. Create account and log in

Set up your Ente account with a secure password and save your recovery key. This guide also covers logging in on all your other devices. Start with our generous 10 GB free plan or choose a paid plan.

Learn more in the [Create account and log in guide](/photos/getting-started/signup).

## 3. Migrate from other services

If you have existing photos in Google Photos, Apple Photos, Amazon Photos, or on your computer, import them into Ente. This step is optional if you're starting fresh.
