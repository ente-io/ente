# Sharing debug logs

In some cases when you report an issue, our customer support might request you
to share debug logs from your app to help our developers find the issue.

Note that the debug logs contain potentially sensitive information like the file
names, so please feel free to not share them if you have any hesitation or want
to keep these private. We will try to diagnose the issue even without the logs,
the logs just make the process a bit faster and easier.
