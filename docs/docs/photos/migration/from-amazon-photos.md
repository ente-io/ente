# Import from Amazon Photos

Migrating from Amazon Photos to Ente requires downloading your photos from Amazon first, then uploading them to Ente. While Amazon doesn't provide a bulk export tool, this guide will help you through the process.

## Understanding Amazon's limitations

Amazon Photos does not provide a way to export all of your photos and videos, or
even albums with a single click. According to their
[help desk article](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVCELKY5JW77VE7W),
you have to select and download photos individually or in batches.

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Download from Amazon Photos

1. Log in to [Amazon Photos](https://www.amazon.com/photos) on your computer
2. Select photos/videos you want to download (you can select multiple at once)
3. Click the download option
4. Choose a download location on your computer
5. Wait for the download to complete

**Tips for downloading:**

- Download in batches by album or year to keep things organized
- Create separate folders for different collections on your computer
- Keep track of what you've downloaded to avoid missing photos

### Step 2: Organize your downloads (Optional)

Before uploading to Ente, you might want to:

- Organize photos into folders by date, event, or album
- Remove duplicates if any were created during download
- Delete unwanted screenshots or photos you no longer need

This organization will be reflected in Ente if you choose the "Separate albums" option during upload.

### Step 3: Upload to Ente

1. Download and install the [Ente desktop app](https://ente.io/download/desktop)
2. Sign in to your Ente account
3. Drag and drop the downloaded folder(s) into the Ente app
4. Choose how to organize: single album or separate albums per folder
5. Let the upload complete

**Upload features:**

- **Resumable**: If uploads get interrupted, drag and drop the same folder again - Ente will skip already uploaded files
- **Original quality**: Your photos are uploaded in their original quality with no compression
- **Metadata preserved**: Photo dates and locations are maintained

## Timeline Expectations

- **Small library (< 10 GB)**: A few hours
- **Medium library (10-100 GB)**: Several hours to a day
- **Large library (> 100 GB)**: May take several days depending on your internet speed

You can use your computer while uploads run in the background.

## What about albums?

Amazon Photos albums won't be automatically preserved. However, if you download each album into a separate folder on your computer, you can use Ente's "Separate albums" option during upload to recreate your album structure.

## After Migration

Once your photos are in Ente:

- [Set up automatic backup](/photos/getting-started/daily-use) for new photos on your mobile devices
- Consider [enabling machine learning](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning) for face recognition and smart search
- Explore [sharing features](/photos/features/sharing-and-collaboration/share) to share albums with family and friends
