# Import from Amazon Photos

Amazon Photos does not provide a way to export all of your photos and videos, or
even albums with a single click.

According to their
[help desk article](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVCELKY5JW77VE7W),
you have to select and download photos individually.

Once you've done that, simply drag and drop this folder into
[our desktop app](https://ente.io/download/desktop), and Ente will take care of
the rest.

> Note: In case your uploads get interrupted, just drag and drop the folder into
> the same album again, and we will ignore already backed up files and upload
> just the rest.

If you run into any issues during this migration, please reach out to
[support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) and we will be happy to help you!
