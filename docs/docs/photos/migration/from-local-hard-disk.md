# Import photos from your local hard disk

Simply drag and drop the folders you want to preserve into
[our desktop app](https://ente.io/download/desktop) and grab a cup of coffee (or
a good night's sleep depending on the size of your library), while we will take
care of the rest.

> Note: in case your uploads get interrupted, just drag and drop the folders
> into the same albums again, and we will ignore already backed up files and
> upload just the rest.

If you run into any issues during uploads, please reach out to
[support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) and we will be happy to help you!
