# Exporting your data out of Ente Photos

Please follow the following simple steps to keep a local copy of the photos and
videos you have uploaded to Ente.

1. Sign in to [our desktop app](https://ente.io/download/desktop), if you
   haven't done so already.

6. In case your download gets interrupted, Ente will resume from where it left
   off. Simply select **Export Data** again and click on **Resync**.

### Sync continuously

You can switch on the toggle to **Sync continuously** to eliminate manual
exports each time new photos are added to Ente. This feature automatically
detects new files and runs exports accordingly. It also ensures that exported
data reflects the latest album states with new files, moves, and deletions.
