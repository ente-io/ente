# Import from Apple Photos

## Mobile

If you are using Apple Photos on your phone, then the most seamless way is to
install the Ente app on your mobile device. The Ente app will directly read from
your iCloud library and import.

> [!TIP]
>
> For large libraries, this process may take a bit of time, so you can speed it
> up by keeping the app running in the foreground while the initial import is in
> progress. You can do this by going to `Settings > Backup > Backup settings` and
> turning on "Disable auto lock"
> (Note: this is only needed during the initial import, subsequently
> the app will automatically backup photos in the background as you take them).
