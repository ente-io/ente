it with Ente.

### Steps

1. Open [takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com).

2. Click on "Deselect All" (since by default all Google services are selected).

10. Wait for the uploads to complete as Ente parses the metadata generated by
    Google, and preserves them along with the corresponding files, end-to-end
    encrypted!

In case your uploads get interrupted, just drag and drop the file again and we
will ignore already backed up files and upload just the rest.

If you run into any issues during this migration, please reach out to
[support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) and we will be happy to help you!

> Note: When importing a Google takeout, Ente will parse the metadata in the
> JSON files and stich them together with corresponding files. However, one case
> this will not work is when Google has split the export into multiple parts,
> and did not put the JSON file associated with an image in the same exported
> zip.
