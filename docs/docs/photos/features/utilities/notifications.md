# Notifications

Ente can send notifications to keep you updated on shared content and remind you of meaningful memories at the right time.

> **Note**: Notifications are currently only available on mobile apps (iOS and Android). Desktop and web versions do not support notifications.

**What happens when you tap:**

- Opens the shared album directly
- Shows the newly added photos

### "On this day" memories

Receive reminders about memories from this day in previous years.
