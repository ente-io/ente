# Collage (mobile)

Create quick collages on iOS or Android by selecting a handful of photos and arranging them into a layout you can save or share.

> **Note**: Collage is available only in the mobile apps (iOS and Android). Web and desktop do not support collage creation.

## Create a collage

1. In the Photos tab, long-press to enter selection mode and pick **2–6 photos** (videos are not supported in collages).
2. Tap **Create collage** in the bottom action bar.
3. Choose a layout from the options shown under **Layout**.
4. Tap **Save** in the app bar to export the collage to your device gallery.

## Arrange and swap photos

- **Swap positions**: Long-press a photo in the collage preview to select it, then tap another photo to swap their spots. Tap the selected photo again to cancel the selection.
- **Adjust framing**: Pinch and drag inside any photo tile to zoom or reposition the image within its slot.

## Tips

- If the collage action is hidden, ensure you have only photos selected (no videos) and that you're within the 2–6 item limit.
- Saved collages appear in your device gallery and can be viewed or shared like any other photo.
