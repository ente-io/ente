# Home Widgets

Ente Photos offers home screen widgets that display your photos directly on your phone's home screen. Widgets automatically refresh with new photos from your library, bringing your memories to life throughout the day.

> **Note**: Home widgets are available on mobile apps only (iOS and Android).

## Widget Types

Ente provides three types of home screen widgets:

### Memories Widget

Displays photos from your memories, including:

- **On This Day**: Photos from the same date in previous years
- **Past Years**: Memories from past years
- **Smart Memories**: AI-curated memorable moments

The Memories widget automatically rotates through your memories, surfacing nostalgic moments right on your home screen.

### Albums Widget

Shows photos from your selected albums. By default, it displays photos from your **Favorites** album, but you can customize which albums to include.

### People Widget

Displays photos featuring selected people from your library. This widget helps you keep photos of your loved ones front and center.

**Requirement**: The People widget requires [face recognition](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/face-recognition) to be enabled. You must first enable machine learning and allow face recognition to detect and group people in your photos.

## How Widgets Work

### Data Synchronization

Widgets sync photos from your Ente library to your device's widget storage:

1. The app selects photos based on your widget configuration
2. Thumbnails are rendered and cached locally (512px resolution)
3. Up to 50 photos are cached per widget type
4. Widgets read from this local cache to display photos

### Automatic Refresh

Widgets automatically refresh approximately every **15 minutes** to display new photos. The refresh happens in the background, so you'll see different photos throughout the day without any manual intervention.

### Tapping Widgets

When you tap a photo on a widget:

- The Ente app opens directly to that photo
- For Memories widgets, you'll see the memory collection
- For Albums widgets, you'll see the photo in its album context
- For People widgets, you'll see photos of that person

## Tips for Best Experience

### Ensure Photos Are Backed Up

Widgets display photos that are backed up to Ente. Make sure your photos are synced for the best widget experience.

### Enable Face Recognition Early

If you want to use the People widget, enable face recognition in advance so the app can detect and group faces in your photos.

Open `Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning` and enable face recognition.

### Keep the App Updated

Widget improvements are released regularly. Keep the Ente app updated for the best performance and new features.

### Add Favorite Photos

The Albums widget defaults to your Favorites album. Add photos to Favorites by tapping the heart icon on any photo. This ensures your most cherished photos appear on your home screen.
