# Swipe to Select

Swipe to Select lets you quickly select multiple photos by dragging your finger across the gallery, making it easy to organize large collections of photos.

## How it works

After selecting at least one photo, drag your finger horizontally to activate swipe-to-select mode. Once activated, you can continue dragging in any direction to select and unselect multiple photos at once. The gallery automatically scrolls when you drag near the top or bottom of the screen, letting you select/unselect photos across the entire collection without lifting your finger.
