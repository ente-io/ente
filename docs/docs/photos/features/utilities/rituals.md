# Rituals

Rituals help you build consistent photo habits by setting up recurring reminders to capture moments from your daily life. Track your progress with streaks, visualize your consistency with a calendar heatmap, and keep your photos organized in dedicated albums.

> **Note**: Rituals are available on mobile apps only (iOS and Android).

## What are Rituals?

A ritual is a photo-taking habit you want to build. Each ritual is linked to an album and can be scheduled for specific days of the week. Ente sends you reminders at your chosen time, and you can track how consistently you're following through with visual streak indicators.

Common ritual examples:
- **Daily gratitude**: Capture something you're grateful for every day
- **Workout progress**: Take a photo after each gym session
- **Meal journal**: Document what you eat
- **Nature walks**: Photograph your outdoor adventures
- **Project progress**: Track a home renovation or creative project
- **Pet moments**: Capture daily moments with your pets

### Viewing Ritual Photos

To see all photos from a ritual:
- Tap the arrow button (►) in the Recent Days section
- Or tap **View album** from the overflow menu
- This opens the ritual album with all your captured photos

### Sharing Your Progress

Share a visual summary of your ritual:

1. Open the ritual detail page
2. Tap the **Share** icon in the top right
3. Ente generates a beautiful card with:
   - Your ritual name and icon
   - Current streak
   - Monthly calendar heatmap
   - Recent photo previews
4. Share the image via your preferred app

## How Streaks Work

### Counting Streaks

Streaks count the number of consecutive scheduled days you've completed:
- Only your selected days of the week count toward streaks
- If you schedule a ritual for weekdays only, weekends don't break your streak
- Today counts toward your current streak only after you've captured a photo

### Maintaining Streaks

Your current streak continues as long as:
- You capture at least one photo on each scheduled day
- Photos are added to the ritual album on the scheduled day
- You don't miss any scheduled days

### Breaking Streaks

A streak breaks when:
- You miss a scheduled day without capturing a photo
- The day ends (midnight in your timezone) before you complete it

> **Tip**: The app is forgiving about "today" — you can still complete today's ritual until midnight to maintain your streak.

## Managing Rituals

### Editing a Ritual

1. Open the ritual detail page
2. Tap the **overflow menu (⋮)** in the top right
3. Select **Edit**
4. Modify any settings:
   - Change the name or icon
   - Adjust scheduled days
   - Update the reminder time
   - Switch to a different album
   - Toggle reminders on/off
5. Tap **Save ritual**

> **Note**: Editing a ritual doesn't affect your existing photos or streak history. Your progress is preserved.

### Deleting a Ritual

1. Open the ritual detail page
2. Tap the **overflow menu (⋮)** in the top right
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion

**What happens when you delete a ritual:**
- The ritual tracker and settings are removed
- Scheduled notifications are cancelled
- **Photos remain safe** in the album — they're not deleted
- Streak history is lost and cannot be recovered

## Notifications

### Setting Up Notifications

Rituals use system notifications for reminders. Ensure notifications are enabled:

**On iOS:**
1. Go to device `Settings > Ente > Notifications`
2. Enable **Allow Notifications**

**On Android:**
1. Go to device `Settings > Apps > Ente > Notifications`
2. Enable notifications
3. Ensure "Rituals" notification channel is enabled

### How Reminders Work

When reminders are enabled for a ritual:
- You'll receive a notification at your scheduled time
- Notifications appear only on days you've scheduled
- Each ritual has its own notification schedule
- Tapping a notification opens the ritual camera
- Notifications are scheduled up to 60 days in advance

### Managing Ritual Notifications

You can control notifications per ritual:
- Edit the ritual and toggle **Send reminder** off to disable notifications
- This keeps the ritual active but stops reminders
- Toggle it back on anytime to resume notifications

## Tips for Success

### Start Small

Begin with one ritual rather than creating many at once. Building one strong habit is better than trying to maintain several inconsistently.

### Choose Realistic Schedules

Schedule your ritual for days and times when you can actually follow through. It's better to do 3 days per week consistently than aim for daily and frequently miss.

### Pick Meaningful Rituals

Choose rituals that align with your goals or interests. You're more likely to maintain habits that genuinely matter to you.

### Use Reminder Times Strategically

Set reminders for times when you'll be able to act immediately:
- After your morning routine
- During lunch breaks
- Before evening activities

Avoid setting reminders when you're typically busy or away from your phone.

### Don't Break the Chain

The visual streak tracker is a powerful motivator. Once you see a growing streak, you'll want to keep it going. Even on difficult days, capturing a single photo maintains your momentum.

### Review Your Progress

Periodically check your ritual's monthly calendar to see patterns. This helps you understand when you're most consistent and when you tend to miss days.
