# Rituals

Rituals help you build a photo habit by prompting you to take photos on specific days and tracking your streaks. Each ritual is tied to an album, and a scheduled day is complete when at least one photo taken that day exists in the ritual album.

> Note: Rituals are available on mobile apps only (iOS and Android).

## How rituals work

- Set a title and emoji icon
- Pick the days of the week and a reminder time
- Choose an album or create a new one
- A day counts as complete when a photo captured on that day is in the ritual album
- Streaks count consecutive scheduled days, not every calendar day

## Create a ritual

1. Open the Search tab and find the Rituals section
2. Tap Create new ritual or the plus button
3. Choose your title, icon, days, and album
4. Toggle reminders and set a time
5. Tap Save

## Capture photos

- Open the ritual and tap the camera button, or tap a ritual reminder notification
- Photos captured from the ritual camera are added to the ritual album automatically
- You can also add photos to the album from anywhere in the app
- Only your own photos count toward completion

## Reminders

- Reminders run on the selected days at the time you choose
- If you add a photo to the ritual album today, the app skips today's reminder
- Turn reminders off per ritual without deleting it

## Track progress

- Rituals show your current streak, longest streak overall, and longest streak this month
- Recent days and the month overview highlight completed days and show the latest photo for each day
- Progress uses the photo capture date in your local time

## Manage rituals

- Edit a ritual to update its title, icon, days, time, or album
- Delete a ritual to remove it and stop reminders
- If the linked album is deleted, the ritual is removed automatically

## Limits and availability

- Each ritual camera session supports up to 20 photos
- The ritual camera currently does not support videos.
- Rituals are stored locally on each device and do not sync across devices
    - But the underlying album does, so you can replicate the ritual easily and use it on multiple devices still.
- Rituals only support albums you own. Hidden and Uncategorized albums are not available
