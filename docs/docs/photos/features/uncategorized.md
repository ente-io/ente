# Uncategorized

_Uncategorized_ is a special album type where photos are automatically added
under the following circumstances:

- When you remove a photo from the last album, it is relocated to
  _Uncategorized_ section.

- During album deletion, if you choose to keep photos but delete the album, all
  photos exclusive to the current album are moved to the _Uncategorized_
  section.

Note: This does not include photos uploaded by others.

### Cleaning up Uncategorized items

In the mobile app, you can click on the overflow menu and click _Clean
Uncategorized_ option. All files that are also present in another album, that is
owned by the user, will be removed from the _Uncategorized_ section.
