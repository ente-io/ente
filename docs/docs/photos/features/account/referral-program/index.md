# Referral program

You can refer your friends to earn free storage on Ente.

For each friend you refer, who upgrades to a paid plan, we will credit **10 GB**
of free storage. The referred customer will also receive an additional **10 GB**
with their paid subscription.

That is, if you refer a friend, once your friend upgrades to a paid plan, both
you and your friend receive an additional 10 GB of storage.

## Find your referral code

You can find your referral code under `Settings > General > Referrals`.
