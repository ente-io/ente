# Account

Your Ente account is the foundation for securely storing and accessing your photos across all your devices. This page provides an overview of account management, security features, and subscription options.

## Using Ente accounts across products

Your Ente account works across both Ente Photos and Ente Auth. You can use the same account for both products, or create separate accounts for each.

> **Note**: If you use the same account for both Photos and Auth and enable 2FA for your Ente account (stored in Ente Auth), this creates a circular dependency. We recommend either:
>
> - Using separate accounts for Auth and Photos for security
> - Ensuring your recovery key is stored securely (written down on paper) as it can bypass 2FA if you're locked out
> - Using [Passkeys](/photos/features/account/passkeys) or [Legacy](/photos/features/account/legacy/) as additional recovery options
>
> Learn more about this scenario in the [Enteception guide](/auth/faq/enteception/).

## Account Creation

Creating an Ente account involves four steps:

1. **Enter and verify your email address** - Used for login and sharing with others
2. **Create a strong password** - The foundation of your end-to-end encryption
3. **Save your recovery key** - The only way to recover your account if you forget your password
4. **Choose a plan** - Start with 10 GB free or select a paid plan

Learn more in the [Creating an account guide](/photos/getting-started/signup).

## Security

### Password and encryption

Your password is used to encrypt all your photos before they're uploaded to Ente's servers. Only you know your password, which means only you can decrypt and view your files.

**Important security practices:**

- Use a strong, unique password
- Never share your password with anyone
- Store your password in a password manager

You can change your password at any time in Settings without re-encrypting your entire library.

### Recovery key

Your **recovery key is a 24-word phrase** that is the only way to recover your account if you:

- Forget your password AND
- Are logged out of all devices

**How to save it:**

- Write it down on paper and store it securely
- Save it in a password manager
- Store it in any secure location you trust

Without your recovery key, losing your password means permanently losing access to your photos.

Learn more in the [Account Creation FAQ](/photos/faq/account-creation#recovery-key).

### Two-factor authentication (2FA)

Ente supports multiple 2FA methods for additional security:

- **TOTP** (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
- **WebAuthn/FIDO2** for hardware security keys
- **Passkeys** as an alternative 2FA mechanism

Enable 2FA in `Settings > Security` on mobile or desktop apps.

Learn more about [Passkeys](/photos/features/account/passkeys).

### End-to-end encryption

Ente uses end-to-end encryption, which means:

- Files are encrypted on your device before upload
- Ente's servers store only encrypted data
- Only you have the keys to decrypt your files
- Even Ente cannot access your photos

**Encryption algorithms:**

- Encryption: XChaCha20 and XSalsa20
- Authentication: Poly1305 MAC
- Key derivation: Argon2id with high parameters

Learn more in the [Security and Privacy FAQ](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy#data-encryption).

Learn more in the [Storage and Plans FAQ](/photos/faq/storage-and-plans#upgrade-plan).

## Storage Management

### How storage is calculated

Ente calculates storage using GibiBytes (GiB):

- Divides total bytes by `1024 x 1024 x 1024` (not `1000 x 1000 x 1000`)
- This means files appear to use less storage compared to providers using GB
- We display it as "GB" without the "i" for simplicity

### Automatic deduplication

Ente automatically detects and handles duplicates:

- Skips identical files uploaded to the same album
- Creates symlinks for files in multiple albums (storage counted only once)
- Works across all your albums automatically
- No manual action required

Learn more in the [Duplicate detection guide](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/duplicate-detection).

### Storage optimization

Free up space with built-in tools:

- **Free up device space** - Remove backed-up photos from your phone
- **Remove exact duplicates** - Find and delete duplicate files
- **Remove similar images** - Use ML to find visually similar photos

Learn more in the [Storage optimization guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/storage-optimization).

## Referral Program

Earn free storage by inviting friends:

- Share your referral code from `Settings > General > Referrals`
- When friends upgrade to a paid plan, both of you get **10 GB free**
- Maximum earned storage equals your plan size (double your storage)
- Earned storage lasts as long as your subscription is active

Learn more in the [Referral program guide](/photos/features/account/referral-program/).

## Account Recovery and Legacy

### Recovery options

If you lose access to your account:

- Use a logged-in device to reset your password
- Use your recovery key if logged out of all devices
- Contact support if you lose access to your email

### Legacy (Trusted Contacts)

Ente offers a legacy feature that allows you to designate trusted contacts who can access your account if something happens to you.
