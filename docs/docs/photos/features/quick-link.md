# Quick link

Quick links allows you to select single or multiple photos and create a link
that you can then share. You don't need to create an album first.

> Behind the scene, Ente creates a special album and put all the selected files
> in that special album.

- You can view all quick links created by you in the sharing tab, under Quick
  links section.

- Quick links can be converted to regular album.

- Removing a link will not delete the photos that are present in that link.

- Similar to a [public-link](./public-link), you can set link expiry, passwords
  or device limits.
