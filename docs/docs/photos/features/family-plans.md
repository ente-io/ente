# Family plans

Paid subscribers of Ente can share the storage with their family, **at no
additional cost** as you have already paid for the storage.

In brief,

- Your family members can use storage space from your plan without paying extra.

- Ask them to sign up for Ente, and then just add them to your existing plan
  using the "Manage family" option within your Subscription settings.

- Each member gets their own private space, and cannot see each other's files
  unless they're shared.

- You can invite 5 family members. So including yourself, it will be 6 people
  who can share a single subscription, paying only once.

## Storage Limits

If you're an admin of a family, you will be able to set storage limits for the 
members in your family plan.

In brief, 

- For example, once you set a limit of 10GB for a member, their Storage
  quota for uploading photos will be limited to 10GB.

- Once the invited member accepts the Family invite, you will be able to see 
  an edit icon in the Members List. Click on it to setup a family limit.

- If the admin has set a limit for any user, that limit value will be prefilled
  in the input box. 

- If you want to remove any storage limit from a members account, you 
  can click on the "Remove Limit" and they can upload photos without any limit.
