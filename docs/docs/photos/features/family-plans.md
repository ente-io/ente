# Family plans

Paid subscribers of Ente can share the storage with their family, **at no
additional cost** as you have already paid for the storage.

In brief,

- Your family members can use storage space from your plan without paying extra.

- Ask them to sign up for Ente, and then just add them to your existing plan
  using the "Manage family" option within your Subscription settings.

- Each member gets their own private space, and cannot see each other's files
  unless they're shared.

- You can invite 5 family members. So including yourself, it will be 6 people
  who can share a single subscription, paying only once.

## FAQ

- **Can you assign a storage quota for each individual member in the family
  plan?**

    Unfortunately, at this moment, assigning a storage quota for each individual
    member in the family plan is not supported. For updates on this feature
    request, please follow
    [this thread](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/857).
