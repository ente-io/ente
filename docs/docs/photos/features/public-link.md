# Public link

Ente lets you share your photos via links, that can be accessed by anyone,
without an app or account.

The contents within these links are also end-to-end encrypted.

> Implementation details have been documented
> [here](https://ente.io/blog/building-shareable-links/).

You can also use these links to collect photos from your friends after a party
or event. Everything they add also remains end-to-end encrypted.

In addition to this, links support the following features:

- Link expiry (so the links go poof after a duration you define)
- Device limits (in case you don't want someone to forwarding your link)
- Password lock (to add an additional level of protection to your photos)
- Prevent downloads (while we can't prevent screenshots, we can disable the
  option to download your original photos)
