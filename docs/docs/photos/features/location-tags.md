# Location Tags

_Search and organize your photos by their location_

Location Tags allow you to search and organize your photos based on their
geographical location. Instead of sending your queries to our servers, we've
implemented a privacy-friendly solution that runs searches locally on your
device.

## How to use Location Tags

### Method 1: Adding Location Tags from a Photo

1. Open a photo
2. Click on _Info_
3. Select _Add Location_"
4. Enter the location name and define a radius

### Method 2: Adding Location Tags from the Search Tab

1. Go to the search tab
2. Click on _Add new_ at the end of the location tags section
3. Select a photo as the center point for the location tag
4. Enter the location name and define a radius

## Tips

- The app will automatically cluster photos falling within a radius under a
  specified location.

- Location Tags provide a seamless way to filter photos without compromising
  your privacy.

- Location tags are stored end-to-end encrypted, ensuring the security of your
  data.

- Enjoy a more organized photo library by tagging important places like home,
  office, and vacation spots.
