# Albums

## Preserving folder structure

When you upload photos and videos into Ente using the desktop app - whether by
dragging and dropping a folder or zip file (or selecting it in the "Upload"
selector), or by setting up a [folder watch](/photos/features/watch-folders) -
the app will provide you various options.

### Uploading files or a folder without nesting

If you are trying to just upload some files, then the app will provide you a
selector where you can choose to (a) uploads all the files to an existing Ente
album, or (b) create a new album.

Similarly, if you upload a folder without any nested folders, than the app will
ask if you want to upload them to an existing Ente album, or create a new album.

The app will also try to intelligently determine the name of the new album.

### Uploading a nested folder

If the folder you're trying to upload has nesting and you select the option to
create a new album, you will see two options - **A single album** and **Separate
albums**.

-   **Single album** will create a new Ente album with the same name as the
    folder's name, and will then sync all the changes in the folder (and any
    nested folders) to this single album.

-   **Separate albums** will create separate albums for each nested folder of
    the selected folder, and will then sync the changes in each nested folder
    separately.

-   For example, suppose you have a folder name `Photos` on your computer, and
    inside that folder you have two nested folders named `New Year` and
    `Summer`. In the single album mode, the app will create an Ente album named
    "Photos" and put all the files from both `New Year` and `Summer` there. In
    the separate album mode, the app will create two Ente albums, "New Year" and
    "Summer", each only containing the respective files.

-   In separate album mode, only nested folders that have at least one file will
    result in the creation of a new album – empty folders (or folders that only
    contain other folders) will be ignored.

-   In separate album mode, only the leafmost folder name is considered. For
    example, both `A/B/C/D/x.png` and `1/2/3/D/y.png` will get uploaded into the
    same Ente album named "D".

> [!NOTE]
>
> Ente albums cannot be nested currently. That is, in the **separate album**
> mode described above, Ente will create a separate album for each nested
> folder, but these Ente albums themselves will not be nested.
