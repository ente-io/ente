# Notifications

The Ente app can send notifications to notify you of an update, or just to
remind you of some sweet or helpful memory at the right time.

## New shared photos

Receive notifications when someone adds a photo to a shared album that you're a
part of.

## "On this day" memories

Receive reminders about memories from this day in previous years. These
reminders will only be shown if there are enough photos taken across previous
years of the specific day.

## Birthday notifications

Receive reminders when it's someone's birthday. Tapping on the notification will
take you to photos of the birthday person. This requires you to first add a
birthday to a person, and will only be shown if there are enough photos of that
person.

## Notification permission

By default all notification categories are enabled if you give notification
permission. You can disable all of the above notification categories from
`Settings > Notifications`. Notifications currently only work on mobile.
