Passkeys are a new authentication mechanism that uses strong cryptography built
into devices, like Windows Hello or Apple's Touch ID. **You can use passkeys as
a second factor to secure your Ente account.**

## Passkeys and TOTP

Ente already supports TOTP codes (in fact, we built an
[entire app](https://ente.io/auth/) to store them...). Passkeys serve as an
alternative 2FA (second factor) mechanism.

If you add a passkey to your Ente account, it will be used instead of any
existing 2FA codes that you have configured (if any).

## Enabling and disabling passkeys

Passkeys get enabled if you add one (or more) passkeys to your account.
Conversely, passkeys get disabled if you remove all your existing passkeys.

To add and remove passkeys, use the _Passkey_ option in the settings menu. This
will open up _accounts.ente.io_, where you can manage your passkeys.

## Login with passkeys

If passkeys are enabled, then _accounts.ente.io_ will automatically open when
you log into your Ente account on a new device. Here you can follow the
instructions given by the browser to verify your passkey.

> These instructions different for each browser and device, but generally they
> will ask you to use the same mechanism that you used when you created the
> passkey to verify it (scanning a QR code, using your fingerprint, pressing the
> key on your Yubikey or other security key hardware etc).

## Recovery

If you are unable to login with your passkey (e.g. if you have misplaced the
hardware key that you used to store your passkey), then you can **recover your
account by using your Ente recovery key**.

During login, press cancel on the browser dialog to verify your passkey, and
then select the "Recover two-factor" option in the error message that gets
shown. This will take you to a place where you can enter your Ente recovery key
and login into your account. Now you can go to the _Passkey_ page to delete the
lost passkey and/or add a new one.
