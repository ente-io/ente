# Collaboration

Ente enables you to collaborate with others in two ways: by sharing albums with other Ente users, or by collecting photos from anyone via public links.

## Collaborating with Ente users

Collaborative albums allow multiple Ente users to contribute photos to the same shared album. This is perfect for ongoing collaboration with family or friends who use Ente.

### How it works

- **Album owner**: The person who created the album
- **Participants**: Added by email address (must have Ente accounts)
- **Permissions**: Owner can assign Viewer, Collaborator, or Admin roles
- **Storage**: Each photo's storage counts towards whoever uploaded it

### Adding participants

1. Open the album you want to share
2. Tap/click the Share icon
3. Select "Share with Ente users" or enter email addresses
4. Choose permissions (Viewer, Collaborator, or Admin)
5. Send the invitation

Recipients receive a notification and can access the shared album from their Ente app.

Multiple albums can be selected (long press to select), and choosing Share will apply sharing to all selected albums at once.

### Permissions explained

**Viewers can:**

- View all photos in the album
- Download photos
- Add photos to their own albums (creates a copy)

**Collaborators can:**

- Everything viewers can do, plus:
- Add new photos and videos to the shared album
- Remove photos they uploaded
- Comment and react (coming soon)

**Admins can:**

- Everything collaborators can do, plus:
- Remove any photo from the album (including photos uploaded by others)
- Add or remove participants (as Admin, Collaborator, or Viewer)
- Suggest deletion for photos owned by others

**Admins cannot:**

- Manage link settings (passwords, expiry, device limits)
- Delete the album
- Permanently delete photos they don't own

**Album owners can:**

- Everything admins can do, plus:
- Manage link settings
- Delete the entire album

### When to use the Admin role

Admins are ideal for trusted participants who help manage a shared album:

- **Family albums**: Trusted family members who help curate and organize photos
- **Group trip albums**: Someone who filters and removes duplicates or blurry photos after a trip
- **Event albums**: A co-organizer who helps manage photos from weddings, parties, or gatherings

Use Collaborator for participants who should only add and view photos without management responsibilities.

### Storage in collaborative albums

Storage is counted towards the person who uploaded each photo:

- When a collaborator adds a photo, it counts towards **their** storage quota
- Since collaborators usually already have the photo in their account, they effectively don't pay extra
- The album owner does not pay for photos uploaded by collaborators
- Storage is only counted once, even if the photo appears in multiple albums

### When participants leave

When a participant is removed from a shared album (or when they leave voluntarily):

- Any photos they uploaded will also be removed from the album
- Those photos remain in the participant's own account
- Photos uploaded by other participants remain in the album
- The removed participant loses access to view the album

### Suggest deletion

Album owners and admins can suggest that other participants delete their photos from shared albums. This is useful when curating a shared album after a group trip or event.

**How it works:**

1. Open a shared album where you are owner or admin
2. Select photos owned by other participants
3. Tap the suggest deletion action
4. Confirm the suggestion

**What happens:**

- Photos are immediately removed from the album
- Photo owners receive the suggestion in their Delete Suggestions queue
- Photo owners can accept (delete) or reject (keep) each suggestion

Photo owners can review delete suggestions in `Settings > Backup > Free up space > Delete suggestions`.

Learn more in the [storage optimization guide](/photos/features/albums-and-organization/storage-optimization#delete-suggestions).

> **Note**: Suggest deletion is currently available on mobile apps only.

### Platform availability

**Mobile apps (iOS and Android):**

- Full support for collaborative albums
- Can view, add, and manage photos

**Web and desktop:**

- Currently view-only mode for collaborative albums
- We're actively working on adding full collaboration support

## Collecting photos from anyone

Collect links allow you to gather photos from people who don't have Ente accounts. This is perfect for collecting event photos from large groups where not everyone uses Ente.

### What are collect links?

Collect links are public links with the "Allow adding photos" option enabled. Anyone with the link can view existing photos and add their own through their web browser - no Ente account or app installation required.

**Common use cases:**

- Wedding photos from guests
- Birthday party memories
- Vacation trip photos
- Conference or event photos
- Any group gathering where you want photos from everyone

### How to create a collect link

**On mobile:**

1. Open the album you want to use for collecting photos
2. Tap the Share icon in the top right corner
3. Select "Collect photos"
4. Tap "Copy link"
5. Share the link with anyone you want to collect photos from

**On web/desktop:**

1. Open the album
2. Click the share album icon
3. Select "Collect photos"
4. Click "Copy link"
5. Share the link with others

Anyone with the link can view existing photos and add their own through their web browser. They can also download photos if you haven't disabled downloads.

### Storage for collected photos

All photos added to your album through a collect link count towards **your storage quota** as the album owner.

When someone adds a photo via a collect link:

- The photo is stored in your account
- You can view, download, and manage it like any other photo
- You can remove collected photos at any time
- Contributors cannot delete photos after uploading

### Managing collect links

**Set limits and protections:**

- **Password protection**: Require a password to access the link
- **Link expiry**: Set when the link should stop working
- **Device limits**: Limit how many devices can access the link (a device is identified by IP address + browser/app combination)
- **Disable downloads**: Prevent people from downloading original quality photos
- **Disable uploads**: Convert to view-only by turning off "Allow adding photos"

**Stop collecting photos:**

1. **Remove the link**: Delete the public link from your sharing settings
2. **Disable uploads**: Edit link settings and turn off "Allow adding photos"
3. **Change to view-only**: Convert the collect link to a regular public link

**View contributors:**
Currently, you cannot see who added which photos to a collect link. All collected photos appear in the album without attribution. We're considering adding this feature based on user feedback.
