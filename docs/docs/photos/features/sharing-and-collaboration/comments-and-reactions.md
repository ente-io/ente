# Comments and Reactions

Comments and reactions let you interact with photos in collaborative albums, making it easy to share thoughts, ask questions, and express appreciation for moments captured by your family and friends.

## What are comments and reactions?

**Comments** allow you to have conversations about specific photos in shared albums. Perfect for:

- Asking questions about a photo ("Where was this taken?")
- Sharing memories and stories ("Remember when...")
- Coordinating with collaborators ("Can someone add more photos from this day?")
- Providing context and details about moments

**Reactions** are quick emoji responses to photos. Use them to:

- Express appreciation (❤️ 👍)
- React to funny moments (😂 🤣)
- Show excitement (🎉 ⭐)
- Acknowledge photos without a full comment
