# Comments and Reactions

Ente lets you comment on and react to shared photos and videos. Whether you're collaborating with family on a vacation album or collecting memories from a wedding, comments and reactions help you engage with shared content while maintaining end-to-end encryption.

## Where comments and reactions work

Comments and reactions are available on:

- **Shared albums**: Albums you've shared with other Ente users or that have been shared with you
- **Public links**: Albums shared via public links, including collect links
- **Both authenticated and anonymous users**: Ente users can comment with their account, while public link visitors can comment anonymously

Comments and reactions are **not available** on private albums that haven't been shared.

## How it works

All comments and reactions are end-to-end encrypted using the album's encryption key. Even though multiple people can interact with your photos, Ente's servers never have access to the unencrypted content of comments or reactions.

When you comment on a photo or react to it, only people with access to that shared album can see your interactions. Anonymous commenters on public links are assigned a temporary identity that's encrypted and tied to the specific album.

## Reacting to photos and videos

### Adding reactions

You can react to any photo or video in a shared album:

**On mobile:**
1. Open a photo in a shared album
2. Tap the heart icon in the bottom bar
3. Your reaction is added instantly

**On web/desktop:**
1. Open a photo in a shared album
2. Click the heart icon in the viewer
3. Your reaction is added instantly

The heart icon fills in to show you've reacted. Tap or click it again to remove your reaction.

### Viewing who liked

To see who has liked a photo:

- On mobile, long pressing the heart icon shows the reactions and on web, right clicking does
- You'll see names for Ente users and display names for anonymous reactors from public links

## Commenting on photos and videos

### Adding comments

**On mobile:**
1. Open a photo in a shared album
2. Tap the comment icon in the bottom bar
3. The comments sheet opens at the bottom
4. Type your comment (up to 500 characters)
5. Tap the send button

**On web/desktop:**
1. Open a photo in a shared album
2. Click the comment icon in the viewer
3. The comments sidebar opens on the right
4. Type your comment and press Enter or click send

Your comment appears immediately for all album participants.

### Replying to comments

You can reply directly to any comment to maintain conversation threads:

**On mobile:**
- **Long press** on a comment bubble and select "Reply", or
- **Swipe right** on a comment to quickly start a reply
- Type your reply and send

**On web/desktop:**
- Right click a comment and click the reply icon
- Type your reply and send

Replies show a quote from the parent comment to maintain context.

### Liking comments

You can react to individual comments:

**On mobile:**
- **Double tap** a comment bubble to quickly like it, or
- **Long press** on a comment and select the heart icon
- The like count appears in the bottom-right corner of liked comments
- Tap the like count to see who liked the comment

**On web/desktop:**
- Right click over a comment and click like

### Deleting comments

You can delete your own comments, and album owners/admins can delete any comment:

**On mobile:**
- Long press on your comment
- Select "Delete"
- Confirm the deletion

**On web/desktop:**
- Hover over your comment
- Click the delete icon (trash can)
- Confirm the deletion

Deleted comments are replaced with "(deleted)" text while preserving the conversation thread structure. Any replies remain visible.

### Multi-album files

If a photo appears in multiple shared albums, you can choose which album's comment thread to view:

- Open the comments view
- Use the album selector dropdown at the top
- Switch between albums to see different comment threads

Each album maintains its own separate comments and reactions for the same photo.

## Comments on public links

### Anonymous commenting

People viewing your album through a public link can comment without creating an Ente account:

**First-time visitors are prompted to:**
1. Enter a display name (used to identify their comments)
2. Start commenting and reacting

The display name is stored encrypted and associated with their browsing session for that specific album.

### Managing public link comments

**Enable or disable comments:**

Album owners can control whether comments are allowed on public links:

1. Open album settings
2. Go to "Manage public link"
3. Toggle "Enable comments and reactions"

When disabled, the comment and reactions and the buttons are hidden from public link viewers.

**Who can delete public link comments:**
- Anonymous commenters can delete their own comments
- Album owners and admins can delete any comment, including anonymous ones

This helps you moderate content collected through public links.

## Feed - Social activity overview

The Feed feature provides a centralized view of all social activity across your shared albums:

**What appears in your feed:**
- New reactions on your photos
- New comments on your photos
- Replies to your comments
- Activity from all shared albums you participate in

**Accessing the feed:**

**On mobile:**
- Go to the "Sharing" tab
- Tap "Feed" at the top
- Scroll through recent social activity

Feed is available on public albums.

The feed updates in real-time as people interact with your shared content, making it easy to stay engaged with collaborative albums without checking each one individually.

## Comment and reaction limits

To maintain performance and prevent abuse:

- **Comment length**: Maximum 500 characters per comment
- **Anonymous display names**: Maximum 50 characters
- **Multi-line support**: Comments can span multiple lines for better formatting
- **One reaction per person**: Each user/anonymous visitor can add one reaction per photo

## Platform availability

**Mobile apps (iOS and Android):**
- Full support for comments and reactions
- Can add, view, reply, like, and delete
- Feed feature available
- Interactive gestures (double-tap to like, swipe to reply)

**Web and desktop:**
- Full support for comments and reactions

## Privacy and encryption

Comments and reactions maintain Ente's strong privacy guarantees:

- **End-to-end encrypted**: All comment text and reaction data are encrypted using the album's encryption key
- **Server-side privacy**: Ente's servers store only encrypted data and cannot read comments or reactions
- **Reaction padding**: Reaction types are padded to a fixed size before encryption to prevent length-based analysis
- **Anonymous privacy**: Anonymous commenter identities are encrypted per-album and not linked across different public links

Even in collaborative albums with many participants, your comments remain private and can only be read by people with legitimate access to the album.
