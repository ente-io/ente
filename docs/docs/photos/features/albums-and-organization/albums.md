# Albums

Albums in Ente are collections that help you organize your photos and videos. Similar to folders on your computer, albums group related photos together - but with some key differences:

**How albums work:**

- Albums are collections of photos and videos
- Each photo can belong to multiple albums simultaneously
- When you add a photo to multiple albums, it only counts once toward your storage
- Albums sync across all your devices automatically

**Key differences from folders:**

- **No nesting**: Unlike folders, albums cannot contain other albums - they're all at the same level
- **Multiple membership**: A single photo can exist in many albums without using extra storage
- **Device-independent**: Albums you create in Ente are separate from folders on your device

## Uploading nested folders from desktop {#preserving-folder-structure}

When you upload photos and videos from your computer using the desktop app - whether by dragging and dropping a folder or zip file, or by setting up [watch folders](/photos/features/backup-and-sync/watch-folders) - you can choose how to handle nested folder structures.

### Single files or flat folders

If you upload individual files or a folder without nested subfolders, the desktop app will ask you to either:

- Upload to an existing Ente album, or
- Create a new album

The app will intelligently suggest a name for the new album based on the folder name.

### Nested folder structures

If the folder contains nested subfolders and you choose to create a new album, you'll see two options:

**Single album:**

- Creates one Ente album named after the parent folder
- All files from all nested subfolders go into this single album
- Example: Folder `Photos` containing `New Year/` and `Summer/` → One album called "Photos" with all files

**Separate albums:**

- Creates a separate Ente album for each nested subfolder
- Only folders containing at least one file become albums (empty folders are ignored)
- Only the leaf folder name is used (e.g., both `A/B/C/Photos/x.jpg` and `1/2/3/Photos/y.jpg` go to an album called "Photos")
- Example: Folder `Photos` containing `New Year/` and `Summer/` → Two albums: "New Year" and "Summer"

> **Note**: Ente albums cannot be nested. In separate album mode, each nested folder becomes a top-level album - they won't be organized in a hierarchy.
