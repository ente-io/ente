# Auto-add people to albums / Smart albums

Automatically add photos of specific people to any album you can edit. Once set up, new matching photos you upload will flow into that album after face recognition indexes them.

## Requirements

- Mobile app with [Machine learning](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/machine-learning) enabled (Settings > General > Advanced > Machine learning / Local indexing)
- People must be named in [Face recognition](/photos/features/search-and-discovery/face-recognition) so they appear in the picker
- You must own the album or be an admin/collaborator (not available for Favorites or Uncategorized)
- Only photos you upload are auto-added; items uploaded by other contributors stay unchanged
- Setup is currently available on mobile; desktop and web cannot configure auto-add yet

## Set up auto-add (mobile)

1. Open the album you want to keep updated
2. Tap the overflow menu (three dots) and choose **Auto-add people** (or **Edit auto-add people**)
3. Select the people to watch for, then tap **Save**
4. The album will start filling with existing matches and will keep adding new uploads that include those people

> Tip: On an empty album, you can also tap **Auto-add people** from the empty state prompt.

## Manage or stop auto-add

- Edit selections: Repeat the steps above to add or remove people
- When removing a person, choose whether to also remove the photos that were previously auto-added for them
- To stop auto-add entirely, deselect everyone and save

Auto-add pauses if machine learning is turned off; re-enable it to resume updates.
