# Hiding photos and albums

You can further protect sensitive photos or albums by hiding them. Hidden photos or albums are **only viewable** after an extra layer of authentication inside the app.

Hiding differs from [Archiving](./archive) in that hidden content won't appear anywhere in the app without explicit authentication, whereas archiving only removes items from the home timeline and memories sections.

- Hidden photos and albums will be removed from home timelines, memories, albums
  tab, search results, and any other visible place in the app.

- Hidden photos will be removed from all regular albums. If you want to unhide
  again you will have to specify the album to move it to.

- You cannot hide photos or albums shared with you. You can archive shared
  albums instead.
