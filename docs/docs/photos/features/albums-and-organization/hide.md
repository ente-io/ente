# Hiding photos and albums

You can further protect sensitive photos or albums by hiding them. Hidden photos or albums are **only viewable** after an extra layer of authentication inside the app.

Hiding differs from [Archiving](./archive) in that hidden content won't appear anywhere in the app without explicit authentication, whereas archiving only removes items from the home timeline and memories sections.

- Hidden photos and albums will be removed from home timelines, memories, albums
  tab, search results, and any other visible place in the app.

- Hidden photos will be removed from all regular albums. If you want to unhide
  again you will have to specify the album to move it to.

- You can hide an album shared with you, but you can't hide an individual
  photo shared with you.

## How to

### Hide album

- Open the album
- Click the overflow menu (three dots)
- Select **Hide album**

### Hide photo

- Select the photo
- Tap/click **Hide** from the selection menu

### View hidden photos and albums

**On mobile:**

- Go to the Albums tab
- Scroll to the bottom
- Tap **Hidden**
- Authenticate with biometrics or passcode

**On web/desktop:**

- Click the menu icon (three horizontal lines) at top left
- Select **Hidden**

### Clean up hidden (mobile only)

On the mobile app, you can perform cleanup actions on your hidden files:

- **Clean up hidden files**: Some files in hidden albums may still exist
  in non-hidden albums, making them visible outside of the hidden
  section. This will remove them from non-hidden albums.
- **Delete hidden files from device**: Delete local copies of hidden
  files from your device.

Note: If you use "Clean up hidden files" and it acts on an album shared
with you, the files from that album that you own will remain in the
hidden section even after you unhide the shared album. You will need to
manually move them from hidden to the album you want them in.

These options appear at the top of the **Hidden** section, and are only
visible when there are files that the action can be performed on.

## Metadata Privacy

Ente has no information about whether you have hidden a photo or album.
