# Uncategorized

**Uncategorized** is a special album where photos are automatically added under the following circumstances:

- When you remove a photo from its last album, it moves to Uncategorized
- During album deletion, if you choose to keep photos but delete the album, all photos exclusive to that album move to Uncategorized

**Note**: This does not include photos uploaded by others.

## Cleaning up Uncategorized items

In the mobile app:

1. Open the Uncategorized album
2. Tap the overflow menu (three dots)
3. Select **Clean Uncategorized**

All files that are also present in another album you own will be removed from Uncategorized.
