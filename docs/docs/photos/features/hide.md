# Hiding photos and albums

You can further protect extra sensitive photos or albums by hiding them. Hidden
photos or albums will **only be viewable** after an extra layer of
authentication inside the app. Hiding differs from [Archiving](./archive.md) in
that the hidden photos won't be surfaced anywhere in the app without explicit
authentication, whereas archiving only removes them from the home timeline and
memories sections.

- Hidden photos and albums will be removed from home timelines, memories, albums
  tab, search results, and any other visable place in the app.

- Hidden photos will be removed from all regular albums. If you want to unhide
  again you will have to specify the album to move it to.

- You cannot hide photos or albums shared with you. You can archive shared
  albums instead.
