# Machine learning

Ente supports on-device machine learning. This allows you to use the latest
advances in AI in a privacy preserving manner.

-   You can search for your photos by the **Faces** of the people in them. Ente
    will show you all the faces in a photo, and will also try to group similar
    faces together to create clusters of people so that you can give them names,
    and quickly find all photos with a given person in them.

-   You can search for your photos by typing natural language descriptions of
    them. For example, you can search for "night", "by the seaside", or "the red
    motorcycle next to a fountain". Within the app, this ability is referred to
    as **Magic search**.

You can enable face recognition and magic search in the app's preferences on
either the mobile app or the desktop app.

On mobile, this is available under `General > Advanced > Machine learning`.

On desktop, this is available under `Preferences > Machine learning`.

The app needs to download your original photos to index them. This is faster
over WiFi. Indexing is also faster on your computer as compared to your mobile
device.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you have a large library on Ente, we recommend enabling this feature on the
> desktop app first, because it can index your existing photos faster. Once your
> existing photos have been indexed, then you can use either. The mobile app is
> fast enough to index new photos as they are being backed up.

The indexes are synced across all your devices automatically using the same
end-to-end encrypted security that we use for syncing your photos.

Note that the desktop app does not currently support modifying the face
groupings, that is only supported by the mobile app.
