# Android

Our Android apps are distributed over the following channels.

### PlayStore

You can install Ente directly from

### F-Droid

Reproducible builds for Ente are available on
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.ente.photos.fdroid/).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Releases over F-Droid are generally slower since they run their own build
> servers. You can donate to F-Droid [here](https://f-droid.org/en/donate).

### GitHub

Latest releases are built straight from the source and made available over
[GitHub](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/releases?q=photos-v1).

These builds will notify you whenever a new release is available and will help
you stay updated.
