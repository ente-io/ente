# Can I hide photos in ente?

Yes, you can hide specific photos and videos in Ente using the "Hide" action.
Open the photo, expand the overflow menu and select Hide (the action with the
eye icon).

Hidden items do not appear anywhere in Ente except within the special "Hidden"
category. Ente will ask for the device biometric (FaceID / TouchID) or passcode
to view the contents of the Hidden category.

You can reach the Hidden category from the bottom of the albums screen.

Keep in mind that hidden items will still show up in the "On device" albums
within Ente as long as they are present in your native gallery. But once you
remove them from your device, they'll stop showing up here.

For more details, see [features/hide](/photos/features/hide).

### Archive

There is also a related feature called "Archive". While hidden items do not
appear anywhere, archived items do not appear in your timeline but can otherwise
be seen within the album and search results.

This is useful when you're not trying to hide certain photos per se, but just do
not want some of them (say, some old screenshots) to clutter your home timeline.

For more details, see [features/archive](/photos/features/archive).
