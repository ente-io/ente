## Installation & Setup

### How do I install Ente Photos on my Android phone? {#install-android}

The easiest way to install Ente Photos for Android is through [PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ente.photos). However, you can also download it through other channels, based on your preferences:

- [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.ente.photos.fdroid/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/releases?q=photos-v1)

### How do I install Ente Photos on my iPhone or iPad? {#install-ios}

You can install Ente Photos on your iPhone or iPad from the [iOS AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1542026904).

### How do I install Ente Photos on my desktop? {#install-desktop}

You can install Ente Photos on your desktop by downloading the installer from [our website](https://ente.io/download/desktop).

**Supported platforms:**

- **Windows**: Download and run the installer
- **macOS**: Download the DMG file
- **Linux**: Download the installer or AppImage

### How do I install CLI for Ente Photos? {#install-cli}

Ente's CLI is distributed directly over [GitHub](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/releases?q=tag%3Acli-v0). The CLI is useful for:

- Automated exports to NAS or local storage
- Bulk operations
- Server-to-server transfers

### Can I access Ente Photos from my browser? {#web-app}

Yes. Ente Photos is also available on the web at [web.ente.io](https://web.ente.io). It offers most of the functionality of the desktop app, except for machine learning and generating video streams.

You don't need to install anything - just log in with your email and password.

### Why is the latest version not available on F-Droid? {#fdroid-delay}

Releases over F-Droid are generally slower than other stores since they run their own build servers. The latest updates are usually available within 2 weeks of release.

### How can I manually setup Ente Photos installation with Obtanium? {#manual-obtanium}

You can setup [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) to track our GitHub releases by [clicking this link](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/redirect?r=obtainium://app/%7B%22id%22%3A%22io.ente.photos.independent%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fente-io%2Fente%22%2C%22author%22%3A%22ente-io%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22Ente%20Photos%22%2C%22preferredApkIndex%22%3A0%2C%22additionalSettings%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22includePrereleases%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22fallbackToOlderReleases%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22filterReleaseTitlesByRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22filterReleaseNotesByRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22verifyLatestTag%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22dontSortReleasesList%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22useLatestAssetDateAsReleaseDate%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22releaseTitleAsVersion%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22trackOnly%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22versionExtractionRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22matchGroupToUse%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22versionDetection%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22releaseDateAsVersion%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22useVersionCodeAsOSVersion%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22apkFilterRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22ente-photos*%5C%22%2C%5C%22invertAPKFilter%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22autoApkFilterByArch%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22appName%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%2C%5C%22shizukuPretendToBeGooglePlay%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22allowInsecure%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22exemptFromBackgroundUpdates%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22skipUpdateNotifications%5C%22%3Afalse%2C%5C%22about%5C%22%3A%5C%22%5C%22%7D%22%2C%22overrideSource%22%3Anull%7D) to add it instantly.

**Desktop app:**
You'll get an in-app notification to update. Ente desktop includes auto-update functionality - whenever updates are deployed, the app will automatically download and install them.

## Multi-Device Setup

### How do I log in on multiple devices? {#multi-device-login}

After creating your account on one device, you can log in to Ente Photos on all your other devices:

1. Install Ente Photos on the device (see installation guides above)
2. Open the app and select "Existing user"
3. Enter your email address and password
4. You may be asked to verify your email with a 6-digit code
5. Once logged in, your photos will begin syncing automatically

Your entire photo library will sync to this device, and any new photos you back up from any device will appear everywhere.

Learn more in [Creating an account and logging in](/photos/getting-started/signup).

### Can I use Ente on both mobile and desktop? {#mobile-and-desktop}

Yes! You can use Ente Photos on as many devices as you want:

- Install on multiple phones and tablets
- Install on multiple computers
- Use the web app in any browser
- All devices stay in sync automatically

Each device can have its own backup configuration (which albums to back up on mobile, which folders to watch on desktop).

### Do I need separate accounts for different devices? {#separate-accounts}

No. Use the same account across all your devices. Your photos, albums, and all your data will sync seamlessly across all devices where you're logged in.

Only use separate accounts if you want to keep photo libraries completely separate (for example, personal vs. work photos).

## Account Creation & Security

### How do I create a new Ente account? {#create-account}

When you first open Ente Photos, you'll be guided through account creation:

1. **Enter your email address** and verify it with a code
2. **Create a strong password** (this encrypts all your photos)
3. **Save your recovery key** - this is critical for account recovery
4. **Choose a plan** - Start with 10 GB free or select a paid plan

For a detailed walkthrough, see [Creating an account](/photos/getting-started/signup).

### What is the recovery key and why is it important? {#recovery-key}

Your recovery key is the **only way** to recover your account if you:

- Forget your password
- Are logged out of all devices

Since Ente uses end-to-end encryption, we cannot reset your password without your recovery key.

**How to save it:**

- Write it down on paper and store it safely
- Save it in a password manager
- Store it in any secure location you trust

**Never skip this step!** Without your recovery key, losing your password means permanently losing access to your photos.

### How do I reset my password if I lost it? {#reset-password}

On the login page:

1. Enter your email
2. Click "Forgot Password"
3. Enter your recovery key
4. Create a new password

If you don't have your recovery key and are logged out of all devices, we cannot recover your account due to end-to-end encryption.

### Can I change my password later? {#change-password-later}

Yes, you can change your password at any time from Settings. Ente's architecture allows password changes without re-encrypting your entire library.

The privacy of your account depends on password strength - choose a strong one.

### Does Ente support two-factor authentication (2FA)? {#2fa}

Yes! Ente recommends enabling 2FA for additional security. Supported methods include:

- **TOTP** (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
- **WebAuthn/FIDO2** for hardware security keys
- **Passkeys** as an alternative 2FA mechanism

You can set up 2FA in Settings on mobile or desktop apps.

Learn more in our [Security and Privacy FAQ](/photos/faq/security-and-privacy).

### Can I use passkeys instead of passwords? {#use-passkeys}

Passkeys serve as a second factor (2FA) for your Ente account, not as a replacement for your password. When you add a passkey to your account, it will be used instead of TOTP codes for two-factor authentication.

Passkeys use strong cryptography built into your devices (like Windows Hello or Apple's Touch ID), providing a more secure and convenient 2FA method than traditional codes.

Learn more in the [Passkeys feature guide](/photos/features/account/passkeys).

### What happens if I lose my passkey? {#lost-passkey}

If you lose access to your passkey (for example, if you misplace a hardware security key), you can recover your account using your Ente recovery key.

**To recover:**

1. During login, press cancel on the browser dialog asking for passkey verification
2. Select "Recover two-factor" in the error message
3. Enter your Ente recovery key to log in
4. Go to the Passkey settings page to delete the lost passkey and/or add a new one

If you've lost both your passkey and recovery key, contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) for assistance.

### I'm not receiving the verification code email {#verification-code}

If you're not receiving verification codes:

1. Check your spam/junk folder
2. Wait a few minutes - emails can be delayed
3. Try requesting a new code
4. Make sure you entered the correct email address
5. Contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io) if the issue persists

### What if I lose access to my email address? {#lost-email}

The recovery key does not bypass email verification. For security reasons, Ente does not disable or bypass email verification unless the account owner reaches out and successfully verifies their identity by providing account details.

If you lose access to your email, contact [support@ente.io](mailto:support@ente.io).
