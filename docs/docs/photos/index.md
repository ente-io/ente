# Ente Photos

Ente Photos is an end-to-end encrypted alternative to Google Photos and Apple
Photos. You can use it to safely and securely store your photos on the cloud.

While security and privacy form the bedrock of Ente Photos, it is not at the
cost of usability. The user interface is simple, and we are continuously working
to make it even simpler.

The goal is a product that can be used by people with all sorts of technical
ability and background.

These help docs are divided into four sections. Choose the relevant page from
the sidebar menu, or use the search at the top.
