Migrating from Authy can be tiring, as you cannot export your 2FA codes through
the app, meaning that you would have to reconfigure 2FA for all of your accounts
for your new 2FA authenticator. However, easier ways exist to export your codes
out of Authy. This guide will cover two of the most used methods for migrating
from Authy to Ente Authenticator.

## Method 1: Use Neeraj's export tool

**Who should use this?** General users who want to save time by skipping the
hard (and rather technical) parts of the process.<br><br>

One way to export is to
[use this tool by Neeraj](https://github.com/ua741/authy-export/releases/tag/v0.0.4)
to simplify the process and skip directly to importing to Ente Authenticator.

To export from Authy, download the tool for your specific OS, then type the
following in your terminal:

```
./<binary-name> <path_to_export_file>
```

Assuming the filename of the binary remains unmodified and the working directory
of the terminal is the location of the binary, you should type this for MacOS:

> [!NOTE]
>
> On Apple Silicon devices, Rosetta 2 may be required to run the binary.

```
./authy-export-darwin-amd64 authy_codes.txt
```

For Linux:

```
./authy-export-linux-amd64 authy_codes.txt
```

For Windows:

```
./authy-export-windows-amd64.exe authy_codes.txt
```

This will generate a text file called `authy_codes.txt`, which contains your
Authy codes in Ente's plaintext export format. You can now import this to Ente
Authenticator!

## Method 2: Use gboudreau's GitHub guide

**Who should use this?** Power users who have spare time on their hands and
prefer a more "known and established" solution to exporting Authy codes.<br><br>

A user on GitHub (gboudreau) wrote a guide to export codes from Authy (morpheus
on Discord found this and showed it to us), so we are going to be using that for
the migration.

To export your data, please follow
[this guide](https://gist.github.com/gboudreau/94bb0c11a6209c82418d01a59d958c93).

This will create a JSON file called `authy-to-bitwarden-export.json`, which
contains your Authy codes in Bitwarden's export format. You can now import this
to Ente Authenticator!

### Method 2.1: If the export worked, but the import didn't

> [!NOTE]
>
> This is intended only for users who successfully exported their codes using
> the guide in method 2, but could not import it to Ente Authenticator for
> whatever reason. If the import was successful, or you haven't tried to import
> the codes yet, ignore this section.
>
> If the export itself failed, try using
> [**method 1**](#method-1-use-neeraj-s-export-tool) instead.

Usually, you should be able to import Bitwarden exports directly into Ente
Authenticator. In case this didn't work for whatever reason, I've written a
program in Python that converts the JSON file into a TXT file that Ente
Authenticator can use, so you can try importing using plain text import instead.

You can download my program
[here](https://github.com/gweeeen/ducky/blob/main/duckys_other_stuff/authy_to_ente.py),
or you can copy the program below:

```py
import json
import os

totp = []

accounts = json.load(open('authy-to-bitwarden-export.json','r',encoding='utf-8'))

for account in accounts['items']:
    totp.append(account['login']['totp']+'\n')

writer = open('auth_codes.txt','w+',encoding='utf-8')
writer.writelines(totp)
writer.close()

print('Saved to ' + os.getcwd() + '/auth_codes.txt')
```

To convert the file with this program, you will need to install
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your computer.

Before you run the program, make sure that both the Python program and the JSON
file are in the same directory, otherwise this will not work!

To run the Python program, open it in your IDE and run the program, or open your
terminal and type `python3 authy_to_ente.py` (MacOS/Linux, or any other OS that
uses bash) or `py -3 authy_to_ente.py` (Windows). Once you run it, a new TXT
file called `auth_codes.txt` will be generated. You can now import your data to
Ente Authenticator!

---

You should now have a TXT file (method 1, method 2.1) or a JSON file (method 2)
that countains your TOTP secrets, which can now be imported into Ente
Authenticator. To import your codes, please follow one of the steps below,
depending on which method you used to export your codes.

## Method 3

**Who should use this?** Power users who have spare time on their hands and who
have a rooted android phone running android 6 or newer that passes Play
Integrity.

This way of exporting your data will require a rooted phone.

### Exporting codes using Android OTP Extractor

This uses the tool
[Android OTP Extractor](https://github.com/puddly/android-otp-extractor) from
[puddly](https://github.com/puddly) on GitHub

1. Install python 3 and adb to your computer you can download binaries for it
   from [Google](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)
2. Add adb to your path. 2.1. On windows search for "Edit the system environment
   variables" 2.2. Click "Environment Variables" 2.3. At the top in "User
   variables" click the "path" variable and then click "Edit" 2.4. Click "New"
   and type the path to where you extracted the Platform Tools
3. Enable USB debugging on the Android Phone 3.1. Open settings 3.2. Open "About
   phone" (Might say tablet depending on what device you use) (skip steps 3.2
   and 3.3 if you already have developer options enabled) 3.3. Tap "Build
   Number" 7 or more times 3.4. Go to the main settings page 3.5. Open "System
   Settings" 3.6. Open "Developer options" 3.7. Enable "USB Debugging" 3.8. On
   your computer verify the phone is connected by running `adb devices` (You may
   need to tap "Allow" on the device to allow the computer to access it)
4. Install Android OTP Extractor using pip
    ```
    pip install git+https://github.com/puddly/android-otp-extractor
    ```
5. Install Authy from the playstore and login to your account
6. Run the command below to export the TOTP to QRCodes and URLS
    ```
    python -m android_otp_extractor --prepend-issuer --include authy
    ```

### Exporting codes using Aegis Authenticator

This uses the tool [Aegis Authenticator](https://getaegis.app/) from
[beemdevelopment](https://github.com/beemdevelopment).

1. Install Authy and login on your rooted phone.
2. Install Aegis Authenticator from the
   [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beemdevelopment.aegis).
3. In the app, click the three dots in the top right corner and click "Import &
   Export".
4. Click "Import from another app" and choose Authy.
5. The app will ask for root permissions, then automatically import your codes
   from Authy.
6. Then export the codes from Aegis Authenticator to `json` or `txt` using the
   "Export to file" option in the "Import & Export" menu.

## Method 4: Authy-iOS-MiTM

**Who should use this?** Technical iOS users of Authy that cannot export their
tokens with methods 1 or 2 (due to those methods being patched) or method 3 (due
to that method requiring a rooted Android device).

This method works by intercepting the data the Authy app receives while logging
in for the first time, which contains your encrypted authenticator tokens. After
the encrypted authenticator tokens are dumped, you can decrypt them using your
backup password and convert them to an Ente token file.

For an up-to-date guide of how to retrieve the encrypted authenticator tokens
and decrypt them, please see
[Authy-iOS-MiTM](https://github.com/AlexTech01/Authy-iOS-MiTM). To convert the
`decrypted_tokens.json` file from that guide into a format Ente Authenticator
can recognize, use
[this](https://gist.github.com/gboudreau/94bb0c11a6209c82418d01a59d958c93?permalink_comment_id=5317087#gistcomment-5317087)
Python script. Once you have the `ente_auth_import.plain` file from that script,
transfer it to your device and follow the instructions below to import it into
Ente Authenticator.

## Importing to Ente Authenticator (Method 1, method 2.1, method 4)

1. Copy the TXT file to one of your devices with Ente Authenticator.
2. Log in to your account (if you haven't already), or press "Use without
   backups".
3. Open the navigation menu (hamburger button on the top left), then press
   "Data", then press "Import codes".
4. Select the "Plain text" option.
5. Select the TXT file that was made earlier.

## Importing to Ente Authenticator (Method 2)

1. Copy the JSON file to one of your devices with Ente Authenticator.
2. Log in to your account (if you haven't already), or press "Use without
   backups".
3. Open the navigation menu (hamburger button on the top left), then press
   "Data", then press "Import codes".
4. Select the "Bitwarden" option.
5. Select the JSON file that was made earlier.

If this didn't work, refer to
[**method 2.1**](#method-2-1-if-the-export-worked-but-the-import-didn-t).<br><br>

## Importing to Ente Authenticator (Method 3)

1. Open Ente Authenticator on your phone
2. Log in to your account (if you haven't already), or press "Use without
   backups".
3. Click the add button in the bottom right of the app.
4. Select "Scan a QR code" and scan the code from the browser.

Now that your secrets are safely stored, I recommend you delete the unencrypted
JSON and TXT files that were made during the migration process for security.
