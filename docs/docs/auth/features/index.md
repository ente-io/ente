# Features

This page outlines the key features available in Ente Auth.

### Icons

Ente Auth supports the icon pack provided by
[simple-icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons). If an icon you
need is missing, please refer to the
[docs/adding-icons](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/mobile/apps/auth/docs/adding-icons.md)
guide for instructions on how to contribute.

### Search

Quickly find your codes by searching based on issuer or account name. You can
also configure the app to focus the search bar automatically on app start by
going to **Settings → General → Focus search on app start**.

### Tags

Organize and filter your codes with ease using tags.

- **Creating a Tag:** When adding or editing a code, tap the orange (+) icon to
  create a new tag.
- **Adding an existing Tag:** When adding or editing a code, select the desired
  tag from the list.

### Pinning

Highlight your frequently used services by pinning them to the top of your code
list. To pin a code, long-press (mobile) or right-click (desktop) the code and
select "Pin".

### Notes

Add additional information to your codes using notes. Notes can be added during
the process of creating or modifying a code.

### Sharing

Securely share codes temporarily with others.

- Long-press (mobile) or right-click (desktop) on a code and choose "Share".
- Select a duration for the shared link: 2 minutes, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes.
- This generates a unique, time-limited link. Recipients can view the codes for
  the specified duration without gaining access to the underlying secret key.
  After the link expires, the recipients will no longer be able to view new
  codes.

### Custom sorting

Customize the order in which your codes are displayed. Ente Auth provides
several sorting options:

- Issuer name
- Account name
- Frequently used
- Recently used
- Manual (custom drag-and-drop order)

Access the sort menu in the top-right corner (next to the search icon) to change
your sorting preference.

### Offline mode

Ente Auth can be used entirely offline. Choose "Use without backups" on the
login screen. In this mode, your codes are stored locally on your device.

Unlike when using an account, data is not synced or backed up to the cloud. You
are responsible for manually backing up your codes.

### Display options

Customize how your codes are displayed for optimal usability.

- **Show large icons:** Display codes with larger icons for enhanced visibility.
- **Compact mode:** Switch to a more compact layout to view more codes on the
  screen simultaneously.
- **Hide codes:** Hide the actual code values for extra privacy. Double-tap a
  code to reveal it when needed.

### App lock

Add an additional layer of protection using the app lock. Choose from the
following lock methods:

- **Device lock:** Use the existing lock configured on your device (e.g., Face
  ID, Touch ID, system password).
- **PIN lock:** Set up a 4-digit PIN code to unlock the app.
- **Password lock:** Set up a password to unlock the app.

Additionally, configure **Auto lock** to automatically lock the app after a
specified period of time (options: Immediately, 5s, 15s, 1m, 5m, 30m).

### Import / Export

Ente Auth offers various import and export options for your codes.

- **Export:** Export your codes in plain text, as an encrypted file, or
  automatically via the CLI.
- **Import:** Import codes from various other authentication apps.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [migration guides](../migration/).

### Deduplicate codes

If you import codes and end up with duplicates, you can easily remove them. Go
to **Settings → Data → Duplicate codes** to find and remove duplicate codes.

### Trash

Manage unwanted codes by moving them to the Trash. The Trash is not cleared
automatically, giving you the flexibility to restore or permanently delete codes
at any time.

- **Trashing a code:** Long-press (mobile) or right-click (desktop) on a code
  and select "Trash" to move it to the Trash.
- **Viewing trashed codes:** If you have trashed codes, you can view them by
  selecting the Trash tag.
- **Managing trashed codes:** In the Trash view, you can either permanently
  delete codes or restore them back to your main list.

### Scan QR

Easily add or share entries using QR codes:

- **Add by scanning (mobile):** On mobile, you can add a new entry by scanning
  the QR code provided by the service. This quickly adds the entry to Ente Auth.
- **Show entry as QR code:** On all apps, you can long-press (mobile) or
  right-click (desktop) a code and select "QR". This allows you to easily share
  the complete entry (including the secret) with others by letting them scan the
  displayed QR code. This can also be used to easily add the same entry to
  another authenticator app or service.
