# Using offline mode safely

Ente Auth can be used without an account by choosing **Use without backups**. In
offline mode, your codes are stored only on that device. They are not synced to
Ente and cannot be restored from Ente's servers.

## How offline storage works

The local vault is encrypted using a key protected by the device's secure
storage, such as the OS keychain, keyring, credential store, or secure storage
service. If that secure-storage key becomes unavailable, Ente cannot recover the
offline vault from the local database alone.

Device transfers and OS backups are not supported recovery methods for
offline-mode codes. They may not include the secure-storage key, or the restored
key may not be usable on the new system.

## Before device or OS changes

If you use Ente Auth in offline mode, create an encrypted export or local backup
before resetting credentials, reinstalling your OS, transferring devices,
restoring a device backup, or making major system changes. Verify that you know
the backup password, and store the backup or export file in a separate location
you can access after the change.

## App lock is not a recovery password

App lock protects access to the app UI. It is not a recovery password for your
codes and does not re-encrypt the stored Auth data.

## Back up your codes

Open `Settings > Data > Local backup` to enable automatic local backups, or
create an encrypted export from the Data settings. Keep your backup or export
files and password somewhere safe.
