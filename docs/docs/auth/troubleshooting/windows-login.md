# Windows Login Error

### HandshakeException: Handshake error in client

This error usually happens when the Trusted Root certificates on your Windows
machine are outdated.

To update the Trusted Root Certificates on Windows, you can use the `certutil`
command. Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Open Command Prompt as Administrator**:
    - Press `Windows + X` and select `Command Prompt (Admin)` or
      `Windows PowerShell (Admin)`.

2. **Run the following command to update the root certificates**:

    ```bash
    certutil -generateSSTFromWU roots.sst
    ```

    This command will generate a file named `roots.sst` that contains the latest
    root certificates from Windows Update.

3. **Install the new root certificates**:

    ```bash
    certutil -addstore -f ROOT roots.sst
    ```

    This command will add the certificates from the `roots.sst` file to the
    Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.

4. **Clean up**: After the installation, you can delete the `roots.sst` file if
   you no longer need it:
    ```bash
    del roots.sst
    ```

Make sure to restart your application after updating the certificates to ensure
the changes take effect.
