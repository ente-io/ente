# Exporting your data out of Ente Auth

## Auth Encrypted Export format

### Overview

When we export the auth codes, the data is encrypted using a key derived from
the user's password. This document describes the JSON structure used to organize
exported data, including versioning and key derivation parameters.

### Export JSON Sample

```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "kdfParams": {
        "memLimit": 4096,
        "opsLimit": 3,
        "salt": "example_salt"
    },
    "encryptedData": "encrypted_data_here",
    "encryptionNonce": "nonce_here"
}
```

The main object used to represent the export data. It contains the following
key-value pairs:

- `version`: The version of the export format.
- `kdfParams`: Key derivation function parameters.
- `encryptedData"`: The encrypted authentication data.
- `encryptionNonce`: The nonce used for encryption.

#### Version

Export version is used to identify the format of the export data.

##### Ver: 1

- KDF Algorithm: `ARGON2ID`
- Decrypted data format: `otpauth://totp/...`, separated by a new line.
- Encryption Algo: `XChaCha20-Poly1305`

##### Key Derivation Function Params (KDF)

This section contains the parameters that were using during KDF operation:

- `memLimit`: Memory limit for the algorithm.
- `opsLimit`: Operations limit for the algorithm.
- `salt`: The salt used in the derivation process.

##### Encrypted Data

As mentioned above, the auth data is encrypted using a key that's derived by
using user provided password & kdf params. For encryption, we are using
`XChaCha20-Poly1305` algorithm.

## Automated backups

You can use [Ente's CLI](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli#readme)
to automatically backup your Auth codes.

To export your data, add an account using `ente account add` command. In the
first step, specify `auth` as the app name. At a later point, CLI will also ask
you specify the path where it should write the exported codes.

You can change the export directory using following command

```
ente account update --app auth --email <email> --dir <path>
```

## Local backups

Ente Auth supports continuous on-device local backups to protect your codes even
when offline. This feature creates encrypted backups on your device
automatically.

**How it works:**

- **Automatic daily backups:** When enabled, Ente Auth creates one local backup
  per day when you open the app.
- **Password-protected:** All local backups are encrypted with a password you
  set. This password is stored securely on your device.
- **Custom backup location:** Choose where to store your backups on your device.
- **Backup retention:** The app keeps up to 5 most recent backups and
  automatically removes older ones.

**Setting up local backups:**

1. Go to **Settings → Data → Local backup**.
2. Enable **Automatic backups**.
3. Set a backup password (minimum 8 characters).
4. Select a folder where backups will be stored.

**Manual backups:**

You can trigger a manual backup at any time using the **Create backup now**
button. Manual backups are useful before making significant changes to your
codes.

## How to use the exported data

- **Ente Authenticator app**: You can directly import the codes in the Ente
  Authenticator app.

    > Settings -> Data -> Import Codes -> Ente Encrypted export.

- **Decrypt using Ente CLI** : Download the latest version of
  [Ente CLI](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/releases?q=tag%3Acli-v0), and run
  the following command

```
  ./ente auth decrypt <export_file> <output_file>
```
