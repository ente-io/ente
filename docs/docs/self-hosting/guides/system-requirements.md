# System requirements

There aren't any "minimum" system requirements as such, the server process is
very light weight - it's just a single go binary, and it doesn't do any server
side ML, so I feel it should be able to run on anything reasonable.

We've used the server quite easily on small cloud instances, old laptops etc. A
community member also reported being able to run the server on
[very low-end embedded devices](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/594).
