# Hosting server and web app using external S3

This guide is for self hosting the server and the web application of Ente Photos
using docker compose and an external S3 bucket. So we assume that you already
have the keys and secrets for the S3 bucket. The plan is as follows:

1. Create a `compose.yaml` file
2. Set up the `.credentials.env` file
3. Run `docker-compose up`
4. Create an account and increase storage quota
5. Fix potential CORS issue with your bucket

## 1. Create a `compose.yaml` file

After cloning the main repository with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ente-io/ente.git
# Or git clone git@github.com:ente-io/ente.git
cd ente
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Create a `compose.yaml` file at the root of the project with the following
content (there is nothing to change here):

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
    museum:
        build:
            context: server
            args:
                GIT_COMMIT: local
        ports:
            - 8080:8080 # API
            - 2112:2112 # Prometheus metrics
        depends_on:
            postgres:
                condition: service_healthy

        # Wait for museum to ping pong before starting the webapp.
        healthcheck:
            test: [
                    "CMD",
                    "echo",
                    "1", # I don't know what to put here
                ]
        environment:
            # no need to touch these
            ENTE_DB_HOST: postgres
            ENTE_DB_PORT: 5432
            ENTE_DB_NAME: ente_db
            ENTE_DB_USER: pguser
            ENTE_DB_PASSWORD: pgpass
        env_file:
            - ./.credentials.env
        volumes:
            - custom-logs:/var/logs
        networks:
            - internal

    web:
        build:
            context: web
        ports:
            - 8081:80
            - 8082:80
        depends_on:
            museum:
                condition: service_healthy
        env_file:
            - ./.credentials.env

    postgres:
        image: postgres:12
        ports:
            - 5432:5432
        environment:
            POSTGRES_USER: pguser
            POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pgpass
            POSTGRES_DB: ente_db
        # Wait for postgres to be accept connections before starting museum.
        healthcheck:
            test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-q", "-d", "ente_db", "-U", "pguser"]
            interval: 1s
            timeout: 5s
            retries: 20
        volumes:
            - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        networks:
            - internal
volumes:
    custom-logs:
    postgres-data:
networks:
    internal:
```

It maybe be added in the future, but if it does not exist, create a `Dockerfile`
in the `web` directory with the following content:

```Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM node:21-bookworm-slim as ente-builder
WORKDIR /app
RUN apt update && apt install -y ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY . .
RUN yarn install
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_ENTE_ENDPOINT=DOCKER_RUNTIME_REPLACE_ENDPOINT
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_ENTE_ALBUMS_ENDPOINT=DOCKER_RUNTIME_REPLACE_ALBUMS_ENDPOINT
RUN yarn build


FROM nginx:1.25-alpine-slim
COPY --from=ente-builder /app/apps/photos/out /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY <<EOF /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  root /usr/share/nginx/html;
  location / {
      try_files \$uri \$uri.html \$uri/ =404;
  }
  error_page 404 /404.html;
  location = /404.html {
      internal;
  }
}
EOF
ARG ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8080"
ENV ENDPOINT "$ENDPOINT"
ARG ALBUMS_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:8082"
ENV ALBUMS_ENDPOINT "$ALBUMS_ENDPOINT"
COPY <<EOF /docker-entrypoint.d/replace_ente_endpoints.sh
echo "Replacing endpoints"
echo "  Endpoint: \$ENDPOINT"
echo "  Albums Endpoint: \$ALBUMS_ENDPOINT"

replace_enpoints() {
  sed -i -e 's,DOCKER_RUNTIME_REPLACE_ENDPOINT,'"\$ENDPOINT"',g' \$1
  sed -i -e 's,DOCKER_RUNTIME_REPLACE_ALBUMS_ENDPOINT,'"\$ALBUMS_ENDPOINT"',g' \$1
}
for jsfile in `find '/usr/share/nginx/html' -type f -name '*.js'`
do
    replace_enpoints "\$jsfile"
done
EOF

RUN chmod +x /docker-entrypoint.d/replace_ente_endpoints.sh
```

This runs nginx inside to handle both the web & album URLs so we don't have to
make two web images with different port.

-   `DOCKER_RUNTIME_REPLACE_ENDPOINT` this is your public museum API URL.
-   `DOCKER_RUNTIME_REPLACE_ALBUMS_ENDPOINT` this is the shared albums URL (for
    more details about configuring shared albums, see
    [faq/sharing](/self-hosting/faq/sharing)).

Note how above we had updated the `compose.yaml` file for the server with

```yaml
web:
    build:
        context: web
    ports:
        - 8081:80
        - 8082:80
```

so that web and album both point to the same container and nginx will handle it.

## 2. Set up the `.credentials.env` file

Create a `.credentials.env` file at the root of the project with the following
content (here you need to set the correct value of each variable):

<!-- The following code block should have language env, but vitepress currently
doesn't support that language, so use sh as a reasonable fallback instead. -->

```sh
# run  `go run tools/gen-random-keys/main.go` in the server directory to generate the keys
ENTE_KEY_ENCRYPTION=
ENTE_KEY_HASH=
ENTE_JWT_SECRET=

ENTE_S3_B2-EU-CEN_KEY=YOUR_S3_KEY
ENTE_S3_B2-EU-CEN_SECRET=YOUR_S3_SECRET
ENTE_S3_B2-EU-CEN_ENDPOINT=YOUR_S3_ENDPOINT
ENTE_S3_B2-EU-CEN_REGION=YOUR_S3_REGION
ENTE_S3_B2-EU-CEN_BUCKET=YOUR_S3_BUCKET
ENTE_S3_ARE_LOCAL_BUCKETS=false

ENTE_INTERNAL_HARDCODED-OTT_LOCAL-DOMAIN-SUFFIX="@example.com"
ENTE_INTERNAL_HARDCODED-OTT_LOCAL-DOMAIN-VALUE=123456

# if you deploy it on a server under a domain, you need to set the correct value of the following variables
# it can be changed later
ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080
ALBUMS_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8082
# This is used to generate sharable URLs
ENTE_APPS_PUBLIC-ALBUMS=http://localhost:8082
```

## 3. Run `docker-compose up`

Run `docker-compose up` at the root of the project (add `-d` to run it in the
background).

## 4. Create an account and increase storage quota

Open `http://localhost:8081` (or the url of your server) in your browser and
create an account. Choose 123456 as the value for the one-time token if your
email has the correct domain as defined in the `.credentials.env` file.

If you successfully log in, select any plan and increase the storage quota with
the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec -i postgres psql -U pguser -d ente_db -c "INSERT INTO storage_bonus (bonus_id, user_id, storage, type, valid_till) VALUES ('self-hosted-myself', (SELECT user_id FROM users), 1099511627776, 'ADD_ON_SUPPORT', 0)"
```

After few reloads, you should see 1 To of quota.

## 5. Fix potential CORS issue with your bucket

If you cannot upload a photo due to a CORS issue, you need to fix the CORS
configuration of your bucket.

Create a `cors.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
    "CORSRules": [
        {
            "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
            "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
            "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
            "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000,
            "ExposeHeaders": ["Etag"]
        }
    ]
}
```

You may want to change the `AllowedOrigins` to a more restrictive value.

Then run the following command with the aws command to update the CORS
configuration of your bucket:

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-cors --bucket YOUR_S3_BUCKET --cors-configuration file://cors.json
```

Upload should now work.
