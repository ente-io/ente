# Guides

If you've figured out how to do something, help others out by adding
walkthroughs, tutorials and other FAQ pages in this directory.

See the sidebar for existing guides. In particular:

- If you're just looking to get started, see
  [configure custom server](custom-server/).

- For various admin related tasks, e.g. increasing the storage quota on your
  self hosted instance, see [administering your custom server](admin).

- For configuring your S3 buckets to get the object storage to work from your
  mobile device or for fixing an upload errors, see
  [configuring S3](configuring-s3). There is also a longer
  [community contributed guide](external-s3) for a more self hosted setup of
  both the server and web app using external S3 buckets for object storage.
