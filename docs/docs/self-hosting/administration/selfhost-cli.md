## Self Hosting

If you are self-hosting the server, you can still configure CLI to export data &
perform basic admin actions.

To do this, first configure the CLI to point to your server. Define a
config.yaml and put it either in the same directory as CLI binary or path
defined in env variable `ENTE_CLI_CONFIG_DIR`

```yaml
endpoint:
    api: "http://localhost:8080"
```

You should be able to
[add an account](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/cli/docs/generated/ente_account_add.md),
and subsequently increase the
[storage and account validity](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/cli/docs/generated/ente_admin_update-subscription.md)
using the CLI.

For administrative actions, you first need to whitelist admin users.
You can create `server/museum.yaml`, and whitelist add the admin userID `internal.admins`. See
[local.yaml](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/server/configurations/local.yaml#L211C1-L232C1)
in the server source code for details about how to define this.

You can use
[account list](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/cli/docs/generated/ente_account_list.md)
command to find the user id of any account.

```yaml
internal:
    admins:
        # - 1580559962386440
```
