# User Management

You may wish to self-host Ente for your family or close circle. In such cases,
you may wish to enable administrative access for few users, disable new
registrations, manage one-time tokens (OTTs), etc.

This document covers the details on how you can administer users on your server.

## Whitelist admins

The administrator users have to be explicitly whitelisted in `museum.yaml`. You
can achieve this the following steps:

1.  Connect to `ente_db` (the database used for storing data related to Ente).

    ```shell
    # Change the DB name and DB user name if you use different
    # values.
    # If using Docker
    docker exec -it <postgres-ente-container-name> sh
    psql -U pguser -d ente_db

    # Or when using psql directly
    psql -U pguser -d ente_db
    ```

2.  Get the user ID of the first user by running the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * from users;
    ```

3.  Edit `internal.admins` or `internal.admin` (if you wish to whitelist only
    single user) in `museum.yaml` to add the user ID you wish to whitelist.

    - For multiple admins:

    ```yaml
    internal:
        admins:
            - <user_id>
    ```

    - For single admin:

    ```yaml
    internal:
        admin: <user_id>
    ```

4.  Restart Museum by restarting the cluster

::: tip Restart your Compose clusters whenever you make changes

If you have edited the Compose file or configuration file (`museum.yaml`), make
sure to recreate the cluster's containers.

You can do this by the following command:

```shell
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

:::

## Increase storage and account validity

You can use Ente CLI for increasing storage quota and account validity for users
on your instance. Check this guide for more
[information](/self-hosting/administration/cli#step-4-increase-storage-and-account-validity)

## Handle user verification codes

Ente currently relies on verification codes for completion of registration.

These are accessible in server logs. If using Docker Compose, they can be
accessed by running `sudo docker compose logs` in the cluster folder where
Compose file resides.

However, you may wish to streamline this workflow. You can follow one of the 2
methods if you wish to have many users in the system.

### Use hardcoded OTTs

You can configure to use hardcoded OTTs only for specific emails, or based on
suffix.

A sample configuration for the same is provided below, which is to be used in
`museum.yaml`:

```yaml
internal:
    hardcoded-ott:
        emails:
            - "example@example.org,123456"
        local-domain-suffix: "@example.org"
        local-domain-value: 012345
```

This sets OTT to 123456 for the email address example@example.com and 012345 for
emails having @example.com as suffix.

### Send email with verification code

You can configure SMTP for sending verification code e-mails to users, if you do
not wish to hardcode OTTs and have larger audience.

For more information on configuring email, check out the
[email configuration](/self-hosting/installation/config#email) section.

## Disable registrations

For security purposes, you may choose to disable registrations on your instance.
You can disable new registrations by using the following configuration in
`museum.yaml`.

```yaml
internal:
    disable-registration: true
```
