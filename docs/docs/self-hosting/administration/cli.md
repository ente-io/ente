# Ente CLI for self-hosted instance

If you are self-hosting, you can configure Ente CLI to export data & perform
basic administrative actions.

::: tip Installing Ente CLI

For instructions on installing the Ente CLI, see the [README available on Github](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/cli/README.md).

:::

## Step 1: Configure endpoint

To do this, first configure the CLI to use your server's endpoint.

Define `config.yaml` and place it in `~/.ente/` or directory specified by
`ENTE_CLI_CONFIG_DIR` or directory where Ente CLI is present.

```yaml
# Set the API endpoint to your domain where Museum is being served.
endpoint:
    api: http://localhost:8080
```

## Step 2: Whitelist admins

You can whitelist administrator users by following this
[guide](/self-hosting/administration/users#whitelist-admins).

## Step 3: Add an account

::: info You can not create new accounts using Ente CLI.

You can only log in to your existing accounts.

To create a new account, use Ente Photos (or Ente Auth) web application, desktop
or mobile.

:::

You can add your existing account using Ente CLI.

```shell
ente account add
```

This should prompt you for authentication details and export directory. Your
account should be added after successful authentication.

It can be used for exporting data (for plain-text backup), managing Ente Auth
and performing administrative actions.

## Step 4: Increase storage and account validity

You can use `ente admin update-subscription` to increase storage quota and
account validity (duration).

For infinite storage and validity, use the following command:

```shell
ente admin update-subscription -a <admin-user-mail> -u <user-email-to-update> --no-limit

# Set a limit
ente admin update-subscription -a <admin-user-mail> -u <user-email-to-update> --no-limit False
```

::: info The users must be registered on the server with same e-mail address.

If the commands are failing, ensure:

1. `<admin-user-mail>` is whitelisted as administrator user in `museum.yaml`.
   For more information, check this
   [guide](/self-hosting/administration/users#whitelist-admins).
2. `<user-email-to-update>` is a registered user with completed verification.

:::

For more information, check out the documentation for setting
[storage and account validity](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/cli/docs/generated/ente_admin_update-subscription.md)
using the CLI.
