Title: Configuring Reverse Proxy - Self-hosting
Description: Configuring reverse proxy for Museum and other services

# Reverse proxy

Reverse proxy helps in making application services accessible via the Internet
without exposing multiple ports for various services.

It also allows configuration of HTTPS through SSL certificate management.

We highly recommend using HTTPS for Museum (Ente's server). For security
reasons, Museum will not accept incoming HTTP traffic.

## Pre-requisites

1.  **Reverse Proxy:** We recommend using Caddy for simplicity of configuration
    and automatic certificate generation and management, although you can use
    other alternatives such as NGINX, Traefik, etc.

    Install Caddy using the following command on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:

    ```shell
    sudo apt install caddy
    ```

    Start the service and enable it to start upon system boot.

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl start caddy
    sudo systemctl enable caddy
    ```

## Step 1: Configure A or AAAA records

Set up the appropriate records for the endpoints in your DNS management
dashboard (usually associated with your domain registrar).

`A` or `AAAA` records pointing to your server's IP address are sufficient.

DNS propagation can take a few minutes to take effect.

## Step 2: Configure reverse proxy

After installing Caddy, `Caddyfile` is created at `/etc/caddy/`. Edit
`/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` to configure reverse proxies.

You can edit the minimal configuration provided below for your own needs.

> yourdomain.tld is an example. Replace it with your own domain.

```groovy
# For Museum
api.ente.yourdomain.tld {
    reverse_proxy http://localhost:8080
}

# For Ente Photos web app
web.ente.yourdomain.tld {
    reverse_proxy http://localhost:3000
}

# For Ente Accounts web app
accounts.ente.yourdomain.tld {
    reverse_proxy http://localhost:3001
}

# For Ente Albums web app
albums.ente.yourdomain.tld {
    reverse_proxy http://localhost:3002
}

# For Ente Auth web app
auth.ente.yourdomain.tld {
    reverse_proxy http://localhost:3003
}

# For Ente Cast web app
cast.ente.yourdomain.tld {
    reverse_proxy http://localhost:3004
}
```

## Step 3: Reload reverse proxy

Reload Caddy for changes to take effect.

```shell
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

## Step 4: Verify the setup

Ente Photos web app should be up on https://web.ente.yourdomain.tld and Museum
at https://api.ente.yourdomain.tld.

> [!TIP] If you are using other reverse proxy servers such as NGINX, Traefik,
> etc., please check out their documentation.
