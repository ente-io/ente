# Configuring Object Storage

Ente relies on [S3-compatible](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/) cloud storage
for storing files (photos, thumbnails and videos) as objects.

Ente ships MinIO as S3-compatible storage by default in quickstart and Docker
Compose for quick testing.

This document outlines configuration of S3 buckets and enabling replication for
further usage.

## Architecture

![Client, Museum, S3](/client-museum-s3.png)

There are three components involved in uploading a file:

1.  The client (e.g. the web app or the mobile app)
2.  Ente's server (museum)
3.  The S3-compatible object storage (e.g. MinIO in the default quickstart)

A file upload flows as follows:

1.  The client asks museum where it should upload the file to.
2.  Museum creates pre-signed URLs for the configured S3 bucket and returns them.
3.  The client uploads directly to the S3 bucket using those URLs.
4.  The client informs museum that the upload is complete, and museum verifies
    the object via a `HeadObject` call.

The important consequence is that **both the client and museum must be able to
reach your S3 bucket at the same address**. Museum embeds the bucket's
`endpoint` value into every pre-signed URL, so an address that only resolves
inside the server (for example `localhost:3200`) will fail when handed to a
phone or another machine on the LAN.

## Museum

The S3-compatible buckets have to be configured in `museum.yaml` file.

### General Configuration

Some of the common configuration that can be done at top-level are:

1. **SSL Configuration:** If you need to configure SSL (i. e., the buckets are
   accessible via HTTPS), you'll need to set `s3.are_local_buckets` to `false`.
2. **Path-style URLs:** Disabling `s3.are_local_buckets` also switches to the
   subdomain-style URLs for the buckets. However, some S3 providers such as
   MinIO do not support this.

    Set `s3.use_path_style_urls` to `true` for such cases.

### Replication

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Replication works only if all 3 storage buckets are configured (2 hot and 1
> cold storage).
>
> For more information, check

> and our article on ensuring [reliability](https://ente.com/reliability/).

Replication is disabled by default in self-hosted instance. Only the first
bucket (`b2-eu-cen`) is used.

Only the names are specifically fixed, you can put any other keys in
configuration body.

Use the `s3.hot_storage.primary` option if you'd like to set one of the other
pre-defined buckets as the primary bucket.

To enable replication after configuring all 3 storage buckets, set `replication.enabled` to `true` in [museum.yaml](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/server/configurations/local.yaml):

```yaml
replication:
    enabled: true
```

### Bucket configuration

The keys `b2-eu-cen` (primary storage), `wasabi-eu-central-2-v3` (secondary
storage) and `scw-eu-fr-v3` (cold storage) are hardcoded, however, the keys and
secret can be anything.

It has no relation to Backblaze, Wasabi or Scaleway.

Each bucket's endpoint, region, key and secret should be configured accordingly
if using an external bucket.

If a bucket has SSL support enabled, set `s3.are_local_buckets` to `false`. Enable path-style URL by setting `s3.use_path_style_urls` to `true`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can configure this for individual buckets over defining top-level configuration if you are using the latest server image (August 2025).

A sample configuration for `b2-eu-cen` is provided, which can be used for other 2 buckets as well:

```yaml
b2-eu-cen:
    are_local_buckets: true
    use_path_style_urls: true
    key: <key>
    secret: <secret>
    endpoint: localhost:3200
    region: eu-central-2
    bucket: b2-eu-cen
```

### Using the mobile app or another device

The quickstart's sample sets `endpoint: localhost:3200`. This works for the
museum container itself (thanks to the `socat` service in `compose.yaml`), but
museum also hands this address back to clients as part of pre-signed upload
URLs. On a phone or any machine other than the server, `localhost` resolves to
the device itself, so uploads never reach MinIO and fail silently. Museum logs
`OBJECT_SIZE_FETCH_FAILED: dial tcp …: i/o timeout` on commit.

Set `endpoint` to an address that is reachable **both** from the museum
container and from your clients. On a LAN, the server's IP works:

```yaml
b2-eu-cen:
    key: <key>
    secret: <secret>
    endpoint: 192.168.1.100:3200
    region: eu-central-2
    bucket: b2-eu-cen
```

With a reverse proxy, use the external hostname (e.g. `s3.example.com`). The
`socat` service in `compose.yaml` is only needed when `endpoint` remains
`localhost:3200`; once you switch to a LAN IP or domain, you can remove it.

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

If you cannot upload a photo due to CORS error, you need to fix the CORS
configuration of your bucket.

Use the content provided below for creating a `cors.json` file:

```json
{
    "CORSRules": [
        {
            "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
            "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
            "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
            "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000,
            "ExposeHeaders": ["Etag"]
        }
    ]
}
```

You may have to change the `AllowedOrigins` to allow only certain origins (your
Ente web apps and Museum) for security.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Newer Ente builds include a `Content-MD5` header on upload requests (and `UPLOAD-URL`
> when routing through the upload worker). If your provider requires an explicit
> allow list instead of `["*"]`, make sure these headers are present in
> `AllowedHeaders`, otherwise preflight checks will fail, and uploads will be
> blocked.

Assuming you have AWS CLI on your system and that you have configured it with
your access key and secret, you can execute the below command to set bucket
CORS. Make sure to enter the right path for the `cors.json` file.

```shell
aws s3api put-bucket-cors --bucket YOUR_S3_BUCKET --cors-configuration /path/to/cors.json
```

### MinIO

Assuming you have configured an alias for MinIO account using the command:

```shell
mc alias set storage-account-alias minio-endpoint minio-key minio-secret
```

where,

1. `storage-account-alias` is a valid storage account alias name
2. `minio-endpoint` is the endpoint where MinIO is being served without the
   protocol (http or https). Example: `localhost:3200`
3. `minio-key` is the MinIO username defined in `MINIO_ROOT_USER`
4. `minio-secret` is the MinIO password defined in `MINIO_PASSWORD`

To set the `AllowedOrigins` Header, you can use the following command:.

```shell
mc admin config set storage-account-alias api cors_allow_origin="*"
```

You can create also `.csv` file and dump the list of origins you would like to
allow and replace the `*` with path to the CSV file.
