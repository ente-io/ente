# Self Hosting

The entire source code for Ente is open source, including the servers. This is
the same code we use for our own cloud service.

> open sourcing of our server useful.

## Getting started

#### Installing Docker

Refer to
[How to install Docker from the APT repository](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)
for detailed instructions.

#### Start the server

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ente-io/ente
cd ente/server
docker compose up --build
```

> [!TIP]
>
> You can also use a pre-built Docker image from `ghcr.io/ente-io/server`
> ([More info](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/server/docs/docker.md))

Install the necessary dependencies for running the web client

```sh
# installing npm and yarn

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
sudo npm install -g yarn // to install yarn globally
```

Then in a separate terminal, you can run (e.g) the web client

```sh
cd ente/web
git submodule update --init --recursive
yarn install
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENTE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080 yarn dev
```

That's about it. If you open http://localhost:3000, you will be able to create
an account on a Ente Photos web app running on your machine, and this web app
will be connecting to the server running on your local machine at
`localhost:8080`.

For the mobile apps, you don't even need to build, and can install normal Ente
apps and configure them to use your
[custom self-hosted server](guides/custom-server/).

> If you want to build the mobile apps from source, see the instructions
> [here](guides/mobile-build).

## Next steps

- More details about the server are in its
  [README](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/server#readme)

- More details about running the server (with or without Docker) are in
  [RUNNING](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/server/RUNNING.md)

- If you have questions around self-hosting that are not answered in any of the
  existing documentation, you can ask in our
  [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions). **Please
  remember to search first if the query has been already asked and answered.**

## Contributing!

One particular way in which you can help is by adding new [guides](guides/) on
this help site. The documentation is written in Markdown and adding new pages is
[easy](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/tree/main/docs#readme). Editing existing
pages is even easier: at the bottom of each page is an _Edit this page_ link.
