# Upgrade your server

Upgrading Ente depends on the method of installation you have chosen.

## Quickstart

::: tip For Docker users

You can free up some disk space by deleting older images that were used by
obsolette containers.

```shell
docker image prune
```

:::

Pull in the latest images in the directory where the Compose file resides.
Restart the cluster to recreate containers with newer images.

Run the following command inside `my-ente` directory (default name used in
quickstart):

```shell
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

## Docker Compose

You can pull in the latest source code from Git and build a new cluster based on
the updated source code.

1. Pull the latest changes from `main`.

    ```shell
    # Assuming you have cloned repository to ente
    cd ente
    # Pull changes
    git pull
    ```

2. Recreate the cluster.
    ```shell
    cd server/config
    # Stop and remove containers if they are running
    docker compose down
    # Build with latest code
    docker compose up --build
    ```

## Manual Setup

You can pull in the latest source code from Git and build a new cluster based on
the updated source code.

1. Pull the latest changes from `main`.

    ```shell
    # Assuming you have cloned repository to ente
    cd ente

    # Pull changes and only keep changes from remote.
    # This is needed to keep yarn.lock up-to-date.
    # This resets all changes made in the local repository.
    # Make sure to stash changes if you have made any.
    git fetch origin
    git reset --hard main
    ```

2. Follow the steps described in
   [manual setup](/self-hosting/installation/manual#step-3-configure-web-application)
   for Museum and web applications.
