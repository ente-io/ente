# Troubleshooting upload failures

Here are some errors our community members frequently encountered with the
context and potential fixes.

Fundamentally in most situations, the problem is because of minor mistakes or
misconfiguration. Please make sure to reverse proxy Museum and MinIO API
endpoint to a domain and check your S3 credentials and whole configuration file
for any minor misconfigurations.

It is also suggested that the user setups bucket CORS or global CORS on MinIO or
any external S3 service provider they are connecting to. To setup bucket CORS,
please
[read this](/self-hosting/administration/object-storage#cors-cross-origin-resource-sharing).

## 403 Forbidden

If museum is able to make a network connection to your S3 bucket but uploads are
still failing, it could be a credentials or permissions issue.

A telltale sign of this is that in the museum logs you can see `403 Forbidden`
errors about it not able to find the size of a file even though the
corresponding object exists in the S3 bucket.

This could be because

1.  The bucket CORS rules do not allow museum to access these objects. For
    uploading files from the browser, you will need to set `allowedOrigins` to
    `*`, and allow the `X-Auth-Token`, `X-Client-Package`, `X-Client-Version`,
    `UPLOAD-URL`, and `Content-MD5` headers configuration too. The new checksum
    header is required by recent builds to verify uploads.
    [Here is an example of a working configuration](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/discussions/1764#discussioncomment-9478204).

2.  The credentials are not being picked up (you might be setting the correct
    credentials, but not in the place where museum reads them from).

## Mismatch in file size

The "Mismatch in file size" error mostly occurs in a situation where the client
is re-uploading a file which is already in the bucket with a different file
size. The reason for re-upload could be anything including network issue, sudden
killing of app before the upload is complete and etc.

## Uploads from mobile or another device time out

If uploads from the web app on the same machine work, but uploads from the
mobile app or another device on your LAN silently fail, and museum logs
`OBJECT_SIZE_FETCH_FAILED: dial tcp …: i/o timeout`, your bucket `endpoint` is
set to an address only the server can reach (typically `localhost:3200` from
the quickstart).

Change `endpoint` in `museum.yaml` to an address reachable from both museum and
the clients - usually the server's LAN IP or a hostname. Learn more in
[Configuring Object Storage](/self-hosting/administration/object-storage#using-the-mobile-app-or-another-device).
