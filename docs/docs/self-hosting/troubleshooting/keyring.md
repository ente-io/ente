# Ente CLI Secrets 

Ente CLI makes use of keyring for storing sensitive information 
like your passwords. And running the cli straight out of the 
box might give you some errors related to keyrings in some case. 

Follow the below steps to run Ente CLI and also avoid keyrings errors. 

Run:

```sh 
# export the secrets path

export ENTE_CLI_SECRETS_PATH=./<path-to-secrets.txt>

./ente-cli
```
You can also add the above line to your shell's rc file, to prevent the need to export manually every time.

Then one of the following:

1. If the file doesn't exist, Ente CLI will create it and fill it with a random 32 character encryption key.
2. If you do create the file, please fill it with a cryptographically generated 32 byte string.

And you are good to go.
