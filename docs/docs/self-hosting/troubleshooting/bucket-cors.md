# Fix potential CORS issues with your Buckets

## For AWS S3

If you cannot upload a photo due to a CORS issue, you need to fix the CORS
configuration of your bucket.

Create a `cors.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
    "CORSRules": [
        {
            "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
            "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
            "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
            "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000,
            "ExposeHeaders": ["Etag"]
        }
    ]
}
```

You may want to change the `AllowedOrigins` to a more restrictive value.

If you are using AWS for S3, you can execute the below command to get rid of
CORS. Make sure to enter the right path for the `cors.json` file.

```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-cors --bucket YOUR_S3_BUCKET --cors-configuration /path/to/cors.json
```

## For Self-hosted Minio Instance

> Important: MinIO does not take JSON CORS file as the input, instead you will
> have to build a CORS.xml file or just convert the above `cors.json` to XML.

A minor requirement here is the tool `mc` for managing buckets via command line
interface. Checkout the `mc set alias` document to configure alias for your
instance and bucket. After this you will be prompted for your AccessKey and
Secret, which is your username and password, go ahead and enter that.

```sh
mc cors set <your-minio>/<your-bucket-name /path/to/cors.xml
```

or, if you just want to just set the `AllowedOrigins` Header, you can use the
following command to do so.

```sh
mc admin config set <your-minio>/<your-bucket-name> api cors_allow_origin="*"
```

You can create also `.csv` file and dump the list of origins you would like to
allow and replace the `*` with `path` to the CSV file.

Now, uploads should be working fine.
