# About

Ente (pronounced en-_tay_. Like ca<i>fe</i>) is a end-to-end encrypted platform
for privately, reliably, and securely storing your data on the cloud. On top of
this platform, Ente offers two products:

- **Ente Photos** - An alternative to Google Photos and Apple Photos

- **Ente Auth** - A free 2FA alternative to Authy

Both these apps are available for all desktop (Linux, Mac, Windows) and mobile
(Android, iOS and F-Droid) platforms. They also work directly in your web
browser without you needing to install anything.

More products are in the pipeline.

## History

Ente was the founded by Vishnu Mohandas (he's also Ente's CEO) in response to
privacy concerns with major tech companies. The underlying motivation was the
understanding that big tech had no incentive to fix their act, but with
end-to-end encrypted cross platform apps, there was a way for people to take
back control over their own data without sacrificing on features.

### What does Ente mean?

In Malayalam, Vishnu's native language, "ente" means "mine". Thus "Ente Photos"
has the literal meaning "my photos".

This was a good name, but still Vishnu looked around for better ones. But one
day, he discovered that "ente" means "duck" in German. This unexpected
connection sealed the deal. We should ask him why he likes ducks so much, but
apparently he does, so this dual meaning ("mine" / "duck") led him to finalize
the name, and also led to the adoption of "Ducky", Ente's mascot:
