# Ente Locker

Ente Locker is a private space to store, share, and pass on your most important
digital information. It's end-to-end encrypted, so we can't see your data - ever.

Locker is available for iOS and Android.

## Keep your family's important information safe

Your family's critical documents and information deserve better protection than
a filing cabinet or cloud drive. Locker gives you a secure, private space to
store what matters most - and ensures your family can access it when they need to.

### What to store in Locker

- **Identity documents**: Passports, IDs, licenses, birth certificates
- **Financial records**: Tax returns, statements, contracts, insurance policies
- **Account credentials**: Your most important accounts that you can't afford to
  lose
- **Medical records**: Insurance cards, vaccination records, prescriptions
- **Physical document locations**: Track where your important papers are stored

## Key features

### Legacy: Ensure your family has access

Life is unpredictable. Legacy ensures your family can access important documents
and information if something happens to you - while protecting against
unauthorized access.

Designate trusted contacts who can recover your account after a waiting period.
You're notified immediately if someone initiates recovery, and you can block it
at any time.

**No other encrypted storage app offers this.**

### End-to-end encryption

Locker encrypts everything before it leaves your device. We use the same
encryption as Ente Photos and Ente Auth. We can't see your data, and neither can
anyone else.

### Collections and organization

Organize items into collections. Items can belong to multiple collections,
making it easy to categorize information in ways that work for you.

### Secure sharing

Share collections with other Ente users, or create public links for individual
items that anyone can view in a browser.

### Open source

Like all Ente products, Locker is fully open source. Anyone can inspect our code
to verify our security claims. View our code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ente-io/ente).

## How Locker works with your other tools

Locker works alongside your existing apps rather than replacing them:

- Use your **password manager** for everyday accounts and daily logins. Use
  Locker for your most important accounts - the ones you can't afford to lose
  access to, like banking, primary email, and critical services.
- Use **Ente Photos** for your photo memories. Use Locker for sensitive document
  scans like passports and tax returns.
- Use **Ente Auth** for TOTP 2FA codes. Use Locker for 2FA backup and recovery
  codes.
- Use your **cloud drive** for everyday files. Use Locker for sensitive
  documents you don't want cloud providers scanning.

## Pricing

Locker is free to use with generous limits:

- **Free plan**: Up to 100 items and 1GB total storage
- **Paid plan** (any Ente subscription): Up to 1000 items and 10GB total storage

Locker's paid limits are included with any Ente Photos subscription. Locker
storage is separate from Photos storage.

- **Families** who want to organize important documents and ensure they're
  accessible if something happens
- **Individuals** who want a secure place for sensitive information
- **Anyone** who values privacy and doesn't want cloud providers scanning their
  documents
