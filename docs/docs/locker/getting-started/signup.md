# Create Account and Log In

Ente Locker uses the same account system as Ente Photos and Ente Auth. If you
already have an Ente account, you can use your existing credentials.

## Creating a new account

1. Open Ente Locker
2. Tap **Create account**
3. Enter your email address
4. Create a strong password
5. Verify your email with the code sent to you
6. **Important**: Save your recovery key when prompted

> **Warning**: Your recovery key is the only way to access your account if you
> forget your password. Store it securely in multiple locations.

## Logging in

1. Open Ente Locker
2. Tap **Sign in**
3. Enter your email and password
4. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, enter your 2FA code

## Using an existing Ente account

If you already use Ente Photos or Ente Auth:

1. Open Ente Locker
2. Tap **Sign in**
3. Enter your existing Ente email and password
4. Your Locker data is securely stored

## Recovery key

Your recovery key is a 24-word phrase generated when you create your account.
This is critical for account recovery.

**Best practices for storing your recovery key:**

- Save it in a password manager
- Write it down and store in a secure location
- Keep copies in multiple places
- Never share it with anyone

## Account limits

Locker has storage limits based on your subscription:

- **Free plan**: Up to 100 items and 1GB total storage
- **Paid plan** (any Ente subscription): Up to 1000 items and 10GB total storage

### What counts as an item

Each of these counts as one item toward your limit:

- Each uploaded document (PDF, image, scan)
- Each personal note
- Each set of account credentials
- Each physical record entry

### Checking your usage

View your current usage in `Settings > Storage` to see how many items you have
and how much storage you're using.

### Upgrading your plan

If you reach your item or storage limit, upgrade to any Ente paid plan to
increase your limits to 1000 items and 10GB storage.
