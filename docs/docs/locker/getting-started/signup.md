# Create Account and Log In

Ente Locker uses the same account system as Ente Photos and Ente Auth. If you
already have an Ente account, you can use your existing credentials.

## Creating a new account

1. Open Ente Locker
2. Tap **Create account**
3. Enter your email address
4. Create a strong password
5. Verify your email with the code sent to you
6. **Important**: Save your recovery key when prompted

> **Warning**: Your recovery key is the only way to access your account if you
> forget your password. Store it securely in multiple locations.

## Logging in

1. Open Ente Locker
2. Tap **Sign in**
3. Enter your email and password
4. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, enter your 2FA code

## Using an existing Ente account

If you already use Ente Photos or Ente Auth:

1. Open Ente Locker
2. Tap **Sign in**
3. Enter your existing Ente email and password
4. Your Locker data will sync across all devices

## Recovery key

Your recovery key is a 24-word phrase generated when you create your account.
This is critical for account recovery.

**Best practices for storing your recovery key:**

- Save it in a password manager
- Write it down and store in a secure location
- Keep copies in multiple places
- Never share it with anyone
