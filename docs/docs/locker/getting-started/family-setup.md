# Family Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up Ente Locker for your family. You'll
learn how to organize important documents, share them securely with family
members, and set up Legacy for digital inheritance.

## Overview

A typical family Locker setup includes:

1. **Individual accounts** for each family member
2. **Shared collections** for documents everyone needs access to
3. **Private collections** for personal items
4. **Legacy contacts** so family members can recover each other's accounts

## Step 1: Set up accounts for family members

Each family member needs their own Ente account to use Locker. There are two
ways to set this up:

### Option A: Separate free accounts

Each family member creates their own free Ente account. This is the simplest
approach and works well for most families.

**For each family member:**

1. Install Ente Locker on their device
2. Create an account with their email address
3. **Important**: Help them save their recovery key securely
4. Enable lock screen protection in `Settings > Security`

With free accounts, each person gets 100 items and 1GB storage for Locker.

### Option B: Ente Family plan (shared subscription)

If you have an Ente Photos subscription, you can add family members to share
your storage quota across Ente products. The Family plan is managed through Ente
Photos.

**To set up a Family plan:**

1. Subscribe to an Ente Photos plan (if you haven't already)
2. Open Ente Photos on your device
3. Open `Settings > Subscription > Manage family`
4. Invite family members by email

Family members share the Photos storage quota and get increased Locker limits
(1000 items and 10GB storage each).

> **Note**: The Family plan requires an Ente Photos subscription and is managed
> through Ente Photos, not Locker. Learn more about
> [Family plans](/photos/features/account/family-plans).

> **Tip**: For children, consider storing their recovery key in a parent's
> Locker as a secure note.

## Step 2: Plan your collection structure

Before adding items, plan how you'll organize them. Here's a recommended
structure for families:

### Shared collections (accessible to all family members)

- **Family Documents**: Birth certificates, marriage certificates, family
  records
- **Medical**: Insurance cards, vaccination records, emergency medical info
- **Home**: Property documents, mortgage info, home insurance
- **Vehicles**: Registration, insurance, maintenance records
- **Emergency Info**: Emergency contacts, important phone numbers

### Individual collections (private to each person)

- **Personal IDs**: Passport, driver's license, social security
- **Financial**: Bank accounts, credit cards, investment accounts
- **Work**: Employment documents, professional credentials
- **Passwords**: Account credentials for personal accounts

## Step 3: Digitize and upload important documents

Gather your family's important documents and upload them to Locker.

### Essential documents to digitize

**Identity documents:**

- Passports (all family members)
- Birth certificates
- Social security cards
- Driver's licenses
- Marriage certificate

**Financial documents:**

- Bank account information
- Insurance policies (health, home, auto, life)
- Tax returns (recent years)
- Investment account details
- Mortgage/lease documents

**Medical documents:**

- Insurance cards
- Vaccination records
- Medication lists
- Doctor contact information
- Medical power of attorney

**Legal documents:**

- Wills
- Powers of attorney
- Trust documents
- Property deeds

### How to upload

1. Use your phone's camera or a scanning app to create clear images or PDFs
2. Open Ente Locker and tap **+**
3. Select **Documents**
4. Choose the scanned file
5. Add a descriptive title (e.g., "John Passport - Expires 2028")
6. Add to the appropriate collection
7. Tap **Save**

## Step 4: Share collections with family members

Share collections so family members can access important documents. In Locker,
you share collections (not individual items) with other Ente users.

### Sharing a collection

1. Open the collection you want to share
2. Tap the share button
3. Select **Share with Ente user**
4. Enter your family member's Ente email address
5. Choose permissions:
   - **Viewer**: Can view items (recommended for most family sharing)
   - **Collaborator**: Can view and add items (for jointly managed collections)
6. Tap **Share**

All items in the collection will be shared with that person.

### Sharing individual items

To share a single item (like a specific document), create a
[public link](/locker/features/sharing/public-links) for that item.

### Recommended sharing setup

| Collection       | Share with         | Permission   |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Family Documents | All family members | Viewer       |
| Medical          | All family members | Viewer       |
| Home             | Adults             | Collaborator |
| Vehicles         | Adults             | Collaborator |
| Emergency Info   | All family members | Viewer       |
| Kids' Documents  | Parents            | Collaborator |

## Step 5: Set up Legacy for account recovery

Legacy ensures family members can recover each other's accounts if needed. This
is essential for:

- Accessing a family member's account if they're incapacitated
- Digital inheritance after death
- Emergency account recovery

### Setting up Legacy

1. Open **Ente Locker**
2. Open `Settings > Account > Legacy`
3. Tap **Add Trusted Contact**
4. Enter your family member's Ente email address
5. They must accept the invite in their Ente app

### Recommended Legacy setup for families

- **Spouses**: Add each other as trusted contacts
- **Parents**: Add adult children as trusted contacts
- **Adult children**: Add parents or siblings as trusted contacts

## Step 6: Create an emergency information sheet

Create a Personal Note with critical information that family members might need
in an emergency:

**Suggested content:**

```
FAMILY EMERGENCY INFORMATION

Emergency Contacts:
- [Name]: [Phone] (relationship)
- Family doctor: [Name, Phone]
- Pediatrician: [Name, Phone]

Insurance Information:
- Health: [Company, Policy #, Phone]
- Home: [Company, Policy #, Phone]
- Auto: [Company, Policy #, Phone]

Medical Information:
- [Family member]: [Allergies, medications, conditions]

Important Locations:
- Safe deposit box: [Bank, Branch, Box #]
- Home safe: [Location, combination in separate note]
- Important documents: [Physical location]

Financial Contacts:
- Bank: [Name, Phone]
- Financial advisor: [Name, Phone]
- Accountant: [Name, Phone]
```

Share this note with all adult family members.

## Best practices for families

### Security

- **Each person has their own account**: Don't share login credentials
- **Store recovery keys securely**: Consider storing children's recovery keys in
  a parent's Locker
- **Enable lock screen**: Protect the app on each device
- **Review sharing regularly**: Check who has access to what

### Organization

- **Use consistent naming**: "John Passport" not just "Passport"
- **Include expiration dates**: "Driver's License - Expires 03/2026"
- **Update promptly**: When documents are renewed, update Locker
- **Note physical locations**: For items like passports, note where the physical
  copy is stored

### Communication

- **Tell family members about Locker**: Make sure everyone knows it exists
- **Explain Legacy**: Help family members understand they can recover your
  account if needed
- **Keep emergency info current**: Review the emergency sheet annually
