# Organization

Ente Locker provides several features to help you organize and find your
documents efficiently. All organization features maintain end-to-end encryption.

## Collections

Collections are like folders that help you group related documents together.
Create collections for work, personal, financial, or any other category that
makes sense for you.

## Search

Quickly find any document by searching titles and content. Search works locally
on your device to maintain privacy.

## Trash

Deleted documents go to Trash where they remain for 30 days before permanent
deletion. Recover accidentally deleted items or empty Trash to remove them
immediately.

## Home screen

The home screen provides quick access to your documents:

- **Recent**: Documents you've recently viewed or edited
- **Collections**: Browse all your collections
- **All documents**: View everything in one list
