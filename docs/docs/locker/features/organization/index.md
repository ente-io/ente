# Organization

Ente Locker provides several features to help you organize and find your items
efficiently. All organization features maintain end-to-end encryption.

## Collections

Collections are like folders that help you group related items together. Create
collections for work, personal, financial, or any other category that makes
sense for you.

## Search

Quickly find any item by searching titles. Search works locally on your device
to maintain privacy.

## Trash

Deleted items go to Trash where they remain for 30 days before permanent
deletion. Recover accidentally deleted items or empty Trash to remove them
immediately.
