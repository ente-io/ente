# Trash

When you delete an item in Ente Locker, it moves to Trash instead of being
immediately removed. This gives you a safety net to recover accidentally
deleted items.

## How Trash works

- Deleted items stay in Trash for **30 days**
- After 30 days, items are **permanently deleted**
- You can restore items from Trash at any time before permanent deletion
- You can manually empty Trash to delete items immediately

## Deleting an item

1. Long press on the item you want to delete
2. Tap the menu icon
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm the deletion

The item is moved to Trash.

## Viewing Trash

1. Open the menu on the home screen
2. Tap **Trash**
3. View all deleted items with their deletion dates

## Restoring an item

1. Open Trash
2. Tap on the item you want to restore
3. Tap **Restore**
4. The item returns to its original collection

## Emptying Trash

### Delete all items

1. Open Trash
2. Tap the menu icon
3. Select **Empty Trash**
4. Confirm permanent deletion

> **Warning**: Emptying Trash permanently deletes all items. This action cannot
> be undone.

### Delete individual items

1. Open Trash
2. Tap on the item you want to permanently delete
3. Tap **Delete permanently**
4. Confirm permanent deletion

## Storage and Trash

Items in Trash **still count** against your storage quota until they are
permanently deleted (either automatically after 30 days or when you manually
delete them).
