# Trash

When you delete a document in Ente Locker, it moves to Trash instead of being
immediately removed. This gives you a safety net to recover accidentally
deleted items.

## How Trash works

- Deleted documents stay in Trash for **30 days**
- After 30 days, documents are **permanently deleted**
- You can restore documents from Trash at any time before permanent deletion
- You can manually empty Trash to delete items immediately

## Deleting a document

1. Open the document you want to delete
2. Tap the menu icon
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm the deletion

The document is moved to Trash.

## Viewing Trash

1. Open the menu on the home screen
2. Tap **Trash**
3. View all deleted documents with their deletion dates

## Restoring a document

1. Open Trash
2. Tap on the document you want to restore
3. Tap **Restore**
4. The document returns to its original collection

## Emptying Trash

### Delete all items

1. Open Trash
2. Tap the menu icon
3. Select **Empty Trash**
4. Confirm permanent deletion

> **Warning**: Emptying Trash permanently deletes all items. This action cannot
> be undone.

## Storage and Trash

Items in Trash **do not** count against your storage quota. Once an item is in
Trash, its storage is freed immediately.
