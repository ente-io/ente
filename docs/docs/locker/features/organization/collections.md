# Collections

Collections help you organize your items into groups. Create collections for
different areas of your life to keep your information structured and easy to
find.

## Items can belong to multiple collections

Unlike folders, items in Locker can belong to multiple collections at once. This
lets you organize the same item in different ways:

- A passport scan could be in both "Travel Documents" and "Family Documents"
- Insurance information could be in "Financial" and "Medical"
- A child's birth certificate could be in "Kids" and "Legal Documents"
