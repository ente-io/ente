# Search

Search helps you find any document in your Locker quickly. Search works locally
on your device to maintain the privacy of your encrypted data.

## Using search

1. Tap the search icon on the home screen
2. Type your search query
3. Results appear as you type
4. Tap a result to open the document

## What is searched

Search looks through:

- **Document titles**: The name you gave each document
- **Collection names**: Names of your collections

> **Note**: Search currently matches document titles and names, not the full
> content within documents. Use descriptive titles to make documents easier
> to find.

## Search tips

### Use specific terms

Search for specific words or phrases that you know appear in your document:

- "Gmail" to find your Gmail credentials
- "passport" to find passport-related records
- "Dr. Smith" to find your doctor's contact

### Partial matches

Search finds partial word matches, so you don't need to type the full word:

- "bank" will find "Banking", "Bank of America", etc.
- "med" will find "Medical", "Medicine", etc.

### Case insensitive

Search is case insensitive, so "Password" and "password" return the same
results.

## Privacy

All search operations happen locally on your device. Your search queries are
never sent to Ente's servers, and your decrypted document content never leaves
your device.

## Limitations

- Search requires documents to be synced to your device
- Very recently created documents may take a moment to become searchable
- Search does not include items in Trash
