# Share Collections with Users

Share collections directly with other Ente users. They'll have access through
their Locker app with full end-to-end encryption.

## How it works

When you share a collection with another Ente user:

1. Your device encrypts the sharing keys using their public key
2. Only their device can decrypt these keys
3. They receive the shared collection in their Locker app
4. Ente's servers never have access to the decrypted content

## Sharing a collection

1. Open the collection you want to share
2. Tap the share button
3. Select **Share with Ente user**
4. Enter the person's Ente email address
5. Choose the permission level:
   - **Viewer**: Can view only
   - **Collaborator**: Can view and add items
6. Tap **Share**

All items in the collection will be shared.

## Sharing individual items

To share an individual item with an Ente user, add it to a collection and share
the collection. Alternatively, you can create a
[public link](/locker/features/sharing/public-links) for the item.
