# Share with Users

Share documents and collections directly with other Ente users. They'll have
access through their Locker app with full end-to-end encryption.

## How it works

When you share with another Ente user:

1. Your device encrypts the sharing keys using their public key
2. Only their device can decrypt these keys
3. They receive the shared content in their Locker app
4. Ente's servers never have access to the decrypted content

## Sharing a document

1. Open the document you want to share
2. Tap the share button
3. Select **Share with Ente user**
4. Enter the person's Ente email address
5. Choose the permission level:
    - **Viewer**: Can view only
    - **Collaborator**: Can view and add items
6. Tap **Share**

## Sharing a collection

1. Open the collection you want to share
2. Tap the share button
3. Select **Share with Ente user**
4. Enter the person's Ente email address
5. Choose permissions
6. Tap **Share**

All documents in the collection will be shared.
