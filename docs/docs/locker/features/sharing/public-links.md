# Public Links

Public links let you share documents and collections with anyone, even if they
don't have an Ente account. Recipients can view the content in their web
browser.

## How it works

When you create a public link:

1. A unique URL is generated containing the decryption key
2. Anyone with the link can view the content in their browser
3. The key is in the URL fragment and never sent to Ente's servers
4. No Ente account is required to view the content

## Creating a public link

### For a document

1. Open the document
2. Tap the share button
3. Select **Create public link**
4. Configure link options (optional)
5. Tap **Create link**
6. Copy and share the link

### For a collection

1. Open the collection
2. Tap the share button
3. Select **Create public link**
4. Configure link options (optional)
5. Tap **Create link**
6. Copy and share the link

## Link options

### Password protection

Add a password that recipients must enter to view the content:

1. When creating or editing a link, tap **Add password**
2. Enter a password
3. Share the password separately from the link

### Link expiration

Set the link to automatically expire:

1. When creating or editing a link, tap **Set expiration**
2. Choose an expiration time
3. After expiration, the link will no longer work

### Device limit

Limit how many devices can access the link:

1. When creating or editing a link, tap **Device limit**
2. Set the maximum number of devices

### Allow downloads

Control whether viewers can download the shared content:

1. When creating or editing a link, find the **Allow downloads** toggle
2. Enable to allow downloads, disable to view-only

When downloads are disabled, viewers can only view content in their browser.

## Managing public links

### Viewing active links

1. Open the document or collection
2. Tap the share button
3. View all active public links

## Security considerations

- Anyone with the link can view the content
- Links can be forwarded to others
- Use passwords for sensitive information
- Set expiration dates when appropriate
- Revoke links when no longer needed

## Viewing public links

Public links open in a web browser. The viewer can:

- View the shared content
- Download the content (if allowed)
- Access on any device with a browser

No Ente app or account is required.
