# Public Links

Public links let you share individual items with anyone, even if they don't have
an Ente account. Recipients can view the content in their web browser.

This is the way to share individual items with others. To share collections, use
[Share with Ente users](/locker/features/sharing/share-with-users) instead.

## How it works

When you create a public link:

1. A unique URL is generated containing the decryption key
2. Anyone with the link can view the content in their browser
3. The key is in the URL fragment and never sent to Ente's servers
4. No Ente account is required to view the content

## Creating a public link

1. Long press on the item you want to share
2. Tap the share button
3. Tap **Share link**

## Deleting a link

1. Long press on the item
2. Tap the share button
3. Tap **Delete link**
4. Confirm deletion

The link will immediately stop working.

## Security considerations

- Anyone with the link can view the content
- Links can be forwarded to others
- Delete links when no longer needed

## Viewing public links

Public links open in a web browser. The viewer can:

- View the shared content
- Access on any device with a browser

No Ente app or account is required.
