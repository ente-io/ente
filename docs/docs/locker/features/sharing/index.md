# Sharing

Ente Locker lets you securely share your documents and collections with others.
All shared data remains end-to-end encrypted.

## Ways to share

### Share with Ente users

Share directly with someone who has an Ente account. They'll receive
notifications and can access shared content from their Locker app.

### Public links

Create shareable links that anyone can access in a web browser without needing
an Ente account. Perfect for sharing with people who don't use Ente.

## Security considerations

### Sharing with Ente users

When you share with another Ente user, the decryption keys are encrypted
specifically for their account. Only they can decrypt and view the content.

### Public links

Public links embed the decryption key in the URL. Anyone with the link can
view the content. Use additional security options like passwords and
expiration dates for sensitive information.

## What you can share

- **Individual documents**: Share a single note, credential, or other document
- **Collections**: Share an entire collection of documents at once
