# Sharing

Ente Locker lets you securely share your collections and items with others. All
shared data remains end-to-end encrypted.

## Ways to share

### Share collections with Ente users

Share collections directly with someone who has an Ente account. They'll receive
notifications and can access shared collections from their Locker app.

[Sharing collections with users](/locker/features/sharing/share-with-users).

### Share items via public links

Create shareable links for individual items that anyone can access in a web
browser without needing an Ente account. Perfect for sharing specific documents
with people who don't use Ente.

### Share text via Ente Paste

Use Ente Paste when you need to share sensitive text quickly with a one-time
link. Pastes are end-to-end encrypted, deleted after first open, and expire
after 24 hours.

## What you can share

| Content     | Share with Ente users | Share via public link | Share via Ente Paste |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Collections | Yes                   | No                    | No                   |
| Items       | No                    | Yes                   | No                   |
| Text        | No                    | No                    | Yes                  |

To share with other Ente users, organize items into a collection and share the
collection. To share individual items with anyone (including non-Ente users),
create a public link.

## Security considerations

### Sharing collections with Ente users

When you share with another Ente user, the decryption keys are encrypted
specifically for their account. Only they can decrypt and view the content.

### Public links

Public links embed the decryption key in the URL. Anyone with the link can view
the content. Delete links when no longer needed.
