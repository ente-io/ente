- **Password**: Your account password
- **Notes**: Additional information about the account (optional)

needed.

pasting into login forms.

## Best practices

- **Use unique passwords**: Store a different password for each account
- **Update regularly**: Keep your stored credentials up to date
- **Add notes**: Include helpful information like security questions, recovery
  emails, or website URLs
- **Organize with collections**: Group related accounts together (e.g., "Work",
  "Banking", "Social Media")

## When to use Locker vs. a password manager

Locker works alongside your password manager rather than replacing it:

- **Your password manager** is for everyday accounts and daily logins with
  browser autofill
- **Ente Locker** is for your most important accounts—the ones you can't afford
  to lose access to

Use Locker for accounts like banking, primary email, and critical services.
These credentials are protected by end-to-end encryption and can be passed on to
family through Legacy if needed. Your password manager handles the rest.
