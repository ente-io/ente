# Account Credentials

Account Credentials let you securely store login information for websites and
services. Keep your usernames and passwords in one encrypted place.

## What you can store

- **Name**: A recognizable name for the account (e.g., "Gmail", "Bank Account")
- **Username**: Your login identifier (username or email)
- **Password**: Your account password
- **Notes**: Additional information about the account (optional)

## Creating account credentials

1. Open Ente Locker
2. Tap the **+** button
3. Select **Account Credentials**
4. Fill in the fields:
    - **Name**: A recognizable name (e.g., "Gmail", "Bank Account")
    - **Username**: Your username or email for the account
    - **Password**: Your password
    - **Notes**: Any additional details (optional)
5. Select a collection (optional)
6. Tap **Save**

## Features

### Password visibility

Passwords are hidden by default. Tap the eye icon to reveal the password when
needed.

### Copy to clipboard

Tap the copy button next to any field to copy it to your clipboard for easy
pasting into login forms.

## Best practices

- **Use unique passwords**: Store a different password for each account
- **Update regularly**: Keep your stored credentials up to date
- **Add notes**: Include helpful information like security questions, recovery
  emails, or website URLs
- **Organize with collections**: Group related accounts together (e.g., "Work",
  "Banking", "Social Media")

## Security note

While Ente Locker encrypts your credentials, it's not a replacement for a
dedicated password manager with browser integration. Consider using Ente Locker
for backup copies or for credentials you don't need to access frequently.
