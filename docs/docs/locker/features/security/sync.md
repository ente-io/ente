# Sync

Ente Locker keeps your data synchronized across all your mobile devices.
Changes made on one device appear on all others, while maintaining end-to-end
encryption.

## How sync works

1. When you create or edit a document, it's encrypted on your device
2. The encrypted data is uploaded to Ente's servers
3. Your other devices download the encrypted data
4. Each device decrypts the data locally

All syncing happens automatically in the background.

## What syncs

Everything in your Locker syncs across devices:

- All document types (notes, credentials, records, contacts)
- Collections and organization
- Sharing settings
- Trash

## Sync status

Check your sync status:

1. Open Ente Locker
2. Look for the sync indicator in the app
3. A checkmark indicates everything is synced
4. A spinning icon indicates sync in progress

## Automatic sync

Locker syncs automatically when:

- You open the app
- You create or edit a document
- You receive shared content
- Background sync triggers (based on device settings)

## Manual sync

Force a sync manually:

1. Pull down on the main screen to refresh
2. Or open `Settings > Sync now`

## Offline access

When offline:

- You can view all previously synced documents
- You can create and edit documents
- Changes sync when you're back online

## Multiple devices

Use Locker on multiple devices:

1. Install Locker on each device
2. Log in with the same Ente account
3. Wait for initial sync to complete
4. All your documents appear on all devices

## Sync and encryption

Sync maintains full encryption:

- Data is encrypted before upload
- Encrypted data travels to Ente's servers
- Other devices download encrypted data
- Decryption happens only on your devices
- Ente's servers never see your decrypted data

## Troubleshooting sync

If documents aren't syncing:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Pull down to force a refresh
3. Check that you're logged into the same account
4. Restart the app
5. Check `Settings` for any sync errors
