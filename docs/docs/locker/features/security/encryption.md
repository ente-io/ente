# Encryption

Ente Locker uses end-to-end encryption to protect your data. Your information is
encrypted on your device before being sent to our servers - we can't see your
data, and neither can anyone else.

## What this means for you

- **Your data is private**: Only you (and people you share with) can see your
  information
- **We can't access your data**: Even Ente employees cannot read your content
- **Your data is safe if we're breached**: Attackers would only get encrypted
  data they can't read

## How it works

1. You create or edit an item
2. Your device encrypts the data using your encryption keys
3. The encrypted data is uploaded to Ente's servers
4. When you need the data, it's downloaded to your device
5. Your device decrypts the data for you to view

## What is encrypted

Everything in Locker is encrypted:

- Item titles and content
- Uploaded files
- Collection names
- Metadata
- Sharing information

## Your keys

### Password

Your password protects your account. Choose a strong, unique password.

### Recovery key

Your recovery key is a 24-word phrase that can recover your account if you
forget your password. Store it securely - it's the only way to regain access.

### Collection keys

Each collection has its own encryption key. This allows secure sharing without
exposing your main keys.

## Security audits

Ente's encryption has been audited by Cure53, a prominent German cybersecurity
firm. Read more about our
[security audits](https://ente.io/blog/cryptography-audit/).

## Technical details

For those interested in the specifics:

- **Encryption**: XChaCha20 and XSalsa20
- **Authentication**: Poly1305 MAC
- **Key derivation**: Argon2id

These algorithms are implemented using
[libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/), an externally audited
cryptographic library.
