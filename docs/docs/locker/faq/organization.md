# Organization FAQ

Answers to common questions about collections, search, and trash in Ente
Locker.

## Collections

### How do I organize my documents? {#locker-organize-documents}

Use collections to group related documents together:

1. When creating a document, tap the collection field
2. Select an existing collection or create a new one
3. Documents in the same collection appear together

Learn more about [Collections](/locker/features/organization/collections).

### Can I create nested collections? {#locker-nested-collections}

No. Collections cannot be nested inside other collections. Locker supports
a flat collection structure.

Use clear, descriptive collection names to organize your documents
effectively (e.g., "Work - Banking", "Personal - Medical").

### What happens if I delete a collection? {#locker-delete-collection}

When deleting a collection, you choose what happens to the documents:

- **Keep documents**: Documents are removed from the collection but remain
  in Locker
- **Delete documents**: Documents are moved to Trash

The collection itself is permanently deleted.

### Can a document be in multiple collections? {#locker-multiple-collections}

Documents have a primary collection, but can also be added to the Important
collection (favorites). When you mark a document as important, it appears in
both its original collection and the Important collection.

For other cases where you need a document accessible from multiple places:

1. Use the Important feature to quickly access key documents
2. Use search to find documents regardless of collection
3. Create a note in another collection that references the original

### How do I rename a collection? {#locker-rename-collection}

1. Open the collection
2. Tap the menu icon
3. Select **Rename**
4. Enter the new name
5. Tap **Save**

### How do I move a document to a different collection? {#locker-move-document}

1. Open the document
2. Tap the edit button
3. Tap the collection field
4. Select the new collection
5. Tap **Save**

## Trash

### How long do deleted items stay in Trash? {#locker-trash-retention}

Deleted items stay in Trash for 30 days, after which they are permanently
deleted automatically.

### Can I recover documents after 30 days? {#locker-recover-after-30-days}

No. After 30 days in Trash, documents are permanently deleted and cannot
be recovered.

If you need to keep something, restore it from Trash before the 30-day
period ends.

### Does Trash count against my storage? {#locker-trash-storage}

No. Items in Trash do not count against your storage quota. Storage is
freed immediately when an item is moved to Trash.

### How do I restore a deleted document? {#locker-restore-document}

1. Open Trash from the menu
2. Find the document you want to restore
3. Tap on it and select **Restore**
4. The document returns to its original collection

### How do I permanently delete items immediately? {#locker-permanent-delete}

To permanently delete a single item:

1. Open Trash
2. Tap the item
3. Select **Delete permanently**

To empty all of Trash:

1. Open Trash
2. Tap the menu icon
3. Select **Empty Trash**

## Search

### Does search work offline? {#locker-search-offline}

Yes. Search works locally on your device using your synced documents.
No internet connection is required.

### Can I search within a specific collection? {#locker-search-collection}

Search currently looks through all your documents. To view only items in
a specific collection, open that collection directly.

### What does search look for? {#locker-search-scope}

Search matches against:

- Document titles and names
- Collection names

Search is case-insensitive and finds partial matches. Use descriptive titles
to make documents easier to find.

### Why are my results not what I expected? {#locker-search-results}

- Check spelling in your search query
- Try searching for different keywords
- Recently added documents may take a moment to become searchable
- Items in Trash are not included in search results
