# Organization FAQ

Answers to common questions about collections, search, and trash in Ente
Locker.

## Collections

### How do I organize my items? {#locker-organize-documents}

Use collections to group related items together:

1. When creating an item, tap the collection field
2. Select an existing collection or create a new one
3. Items in the same collection appear together

Learn more about [Collections](/locker/features/organization/collections).

### Can I create nested collections? {#locker-nested-collections}

No. Collections cannot be nested inside other collections. Locker supports a
flat collection structure.

Use clear, descriptive collection names to organize your items effectively
(e.g., "Work - Banking", "Personal - Medical").

### What happens if I delete a collection? {#locker-delete-collection}

When deleting a collection, you choose what happens to the items:

- **Keep items**: Items are removed from the collection but remain in Locker
- **Delete items**: Items are moved to Trash

The collection itself is permanently deleted.

### Can an item be in multiple collections? {#locker-multiple-collections}

Yes. Items can belong to multiple collections at the same time. This lets you
organize the same item in different ways - for example, a passport scan could be
in both "Travel Documents" and "Family Documents" collections.

To add an item to additional collections:

1. Long press on the item
2. Tap the edit button
3. Tap the collection field
4. Select additional collections
5. Tap **Save**

### How do I rename a collection? {#locker-rename-collection}

1. Open the collection
2. Tap the menu icon
3. Select **Rename**
4. Enter the new name
5. Tap **Save**

### How do I move an item to a different collection? {#locker-move-document}

1. Long press on the item
2. Tap the edit button
3. Tap the collection field
4. Select the new collection
5. Tap **Save**

## Trash

### How long do deleted items stay in Trash? {#locker-trash-retention}

Deleted items stay in Trash for 30 days, after which they are permanently
deleted automatically.

### Can I recover items after 30 days? {#locker-recover-after-30-days}

No. After 30 days in Trash, items are permanently deleted and cannot be
recovered.

If you need to keep something, restore it from Trash before the 30-day period
ends.

### Does Trash count against my storage? {#locker-trash-storage}

Yes. Items in Trash still count against your storage quota until they are
permanently deleted. Storage is freed when items are automatically deleted
after 30 days, or when you manually empty Trash or delete individual items
permanently.

### How do I restore a deleted item? {#locker-restore-document}

1. Open Trash from the menu
2. Find the item you want to restore
3. Tap on it and select **Restore**
4. The item returns to its original collection

### How do I permanently delete items immediately? {#locker-permanent-delete}

To permanently delete a single item:

1. Open Trash
2. Tap the item
3. Select **Delete permanently**

To empty all of Trash:

1. Open Trash
2. Tap the menu icon
3. Select **Empty Trash**

## Search

### Does search work offline? {#locker-search-offline}

Yes. Search works locally on your device. No internet
connection is required.

### Can I search within a specific collection? {#locker-search-collection}

Search currently looks through all your items. To view only items in a specific
collection, open that collection directly.

### What does search look for? {#locker-search-scope}

Search matches against:

- Item titles and names
- Collection names

Search is case-insensitive and finds partial matches. Use descriptive titles to
make items easier to find.

### Why are my results not what I expected? {#locker-search-results}

- Check spelling in your search query
- Try searching for different keywords
- Recently added items may take a moment to become searchable
- Items in Trash are not included in search results
