# Information Types FAQ

Answers to common questions about the different types of information you can
store in Ente Locker.

## General

### What types of information can I store? {#locker-what-types}

Ente Locker supports four information types:

1. **Personal Notes**: Free-form text for any secure notes
2. **Account Credentials**: Usernames and passwords
3. **Physical Records**: Track where physical documents are stored
4. **Emergency Contacts**: Critical contact information

Learn more about [Information Types](/locker/features/information-types/).

### Can I create custom information types? {#locker-custom-types}

Currently, Locker supports only the four built-in information types. Custom
types are not available.

For information that doesn't fit the other types, use Personal Notes with a
clear title and structured content.

### Can I edit a document after creating it? {#locker-edit-document}

Yes. Tap on any document to open it, then tap the edit button to make changes.
Tap Save when finished.

All edits sync automatically to your other devices.

### Can I delete a document? {#locker-delete-document}

Yes. Open the document, tap the menu icon, and select Delete. The document
moves to Trash where it stays for 30 days before permanent deletion.

Learn more about [Trash](/locker/features/organization/trash).

## Personal Notes

### Can I format text in Personal Notes? {#locker-notes-formatting}

Personal Notes support plain text only. Rich text formatting like bold,
italic, or lists is not currently available.

There is no practical character limit for Personal Notes. Store as much
text as you need.

### Can I attach files to notes? {#locker-notes-attachments}

File attachments are not currently supported. Personal Notes store text
content only.

## Account Credentials

### Can I import passwords from other password managers? {#locker-import-passwords}

Password import from other password managers is not currently supported.
You'll need to add credentials manually.

### Does Locker have browser integration? {#locker-browser-integration}

No. Ente Locker is a mobile-only app and does not have browser extensions
or autofill integration.

For frequent password use with autofill, consider using Locker alongside a
dedicated password manager.

Open the credential, then tap the copy icon next to the password field. The
password is copied to your clipboard.

Use the notes field to note important details from the document.

For secure photo storage, consider using Ente Photos.

You have two options:

1. Add all locations in the notes field of a single record
2. Create separate records for each copy with clear names

## Emergency Contacts

### Can I quickly call a contact from Locker? {#locker-call-contact}

contact information and paste it into your phone's dialer. Direct tap-to-call
is not currently supported.

### Can I import contacts from my phone? {#locker-import-contacts}

Contact import from your phone is not currently supported. Add contacts
manually to keep them encrypted and synced.
