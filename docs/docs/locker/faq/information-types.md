# Item Types FAQ

Answers to common questions about the different types of items you can store in
Ente Locker.

## General

### What types of information can I store? {#locker-what-types}

Ente Locker supports four item types:

1. **Documents**: Upload PDFs, images, and scans
2. **Personal Notes**: Free-form text for any secure notes
3. **Account Credentials**: Usernames and passwords
4. **Physical Records**: Track where physical documents are stored

Learn more about [Item Types](/locker/features/information-types/).

### Can I create custom item types? {#locker-custom-types}

Currently, Locker supports only the four built-in item types. Custom types are
not available.

For information that doesn't fit the other types, use Personal Notes with a
clear title and structured content.

### Can I edit an item after creating it? {#locker-edit-document}

Yes. Tap on any item to open it, then tap the edit button to make changes. Tap
Save when finished.

### Can I delete an item? {#locker-delete-document}

Yes. Open the item, tap the menu icon, and select Delete. The item moves to
Trash where it stays for 30 days before permanent deletion.

Learn more about [Trash](/locker/features/organization/trash).

## Documents

### What file formats are supported? {#locker-document-formats}

Documents support common file formats including:

- **PDF files**: Contracts, statements, forms
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, HEIC for scans and photos
- **Other formats**: Various document types

Check the app for the complete list of supported formats.

### Is there a file size limit? {#locker-document-size-limit}

Individual file uploads have size limits. Large files may need to be compressed
or split before uploading. Check the app for current size limits.

### How do I scan a physical document? {#locker-scan-document}

Use your phone's camera or a scanning app to create an image or PDF of the
physical document, then upload it to Locker as a Document.

Many phones have built-in document scanning in the camera app that
automatically crops and enhances the image.

## Personal Notes

### Can I format text in Personal Notes? {#locker-notes-formatting}

Personal Notes support plain text only. Rich text formatting like bold, italic,
or lists is not currently available.

### Is there a character limit for notes? {#locker-notes-limit}

There is no practical character limit for Personal Notes. Store as much text as
you need.

### Can I attach files to notes? {#locker-notes-attachments}

File attachments are not currently supported in Personal Notes. For file
storage, use the Documents item type instead.

## Account Credentials

### Can I import passwords from other password managers? {#locker-import-passwords}

Password import from other password managers is not currently supported. You'll
need to add credentials manually.

### Does Locker have browser integration? {#locker-browser-integration}

No. Ente Locker is a mobile-only app and does not have browser extensions or
autofill integration.

For frequent password use with autofill, consider using Locker alongside a
dedicated password manager.

### How do I copy a password? {#locker-copy-password}

Open the credential, then tap the copy icon next to the password field. The
password is copied to your clipboard.

## Physical Records

### Can I attach photos of physical documents? {#locker-attach-photos}

For photos of physical documents, use the Documents item type to upload images
of the document. Physical Records are designed for tracking locations, not
storing images.

### How do I track multiple copies of a document? {#locker-multiple-copies}

You have two options:

1. Add all locations in the notes field of a single record
2. Create separate records for each copy with clear names
