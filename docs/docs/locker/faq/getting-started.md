## Export and Data

### Can I export my Locker data? {#locker-export}

Data export from Locker is not currently available. This feature is planned for
a future release.

Your data remains accessible as long as you have access to your account, and
you can always view and copy individual items manually.

### What happens if Ente shuts down? {#locker-ente-shutdown}

Ente is committed to data portability and user ownership. If Ente were to shut
down, we would provide advance notice and tools to export your data.

Our code is open source, so the community could also maintain the service
independently.

## Locker, Photos, and Auth

### Should I store document scans in Locker or Photos? {#locker-vs-photos}

Use **Locker** for sensitive documents you need organized access to:

- Identity documents (passports, IDs, licenses)
- Financial documents (tax returns, statements, contracts)
- Medical records
- Legal documents
- Insurance policies

Use **Photos** for general scans that are part of your memory collection:

- Handwritten letters and cards
- Children's artwork
- Old printed photos you're digitizing
- Whiteboard notes from meetings
- Receipts you want to remember but aren't critical

**Key difference**: Locker is for documents you need to find and access by
category. Photos is for memories you browse chronologically.

### Should I store passwords in Locker or use a password manager? {#locker-vs-password-manager}

**Locker complements your password manager** rather than replacing it.

Use your **password manager** for:

- Daily logins with browser autofill
- Generating strong passwords
- Accounts you access frequently

Use **Locker** for:

- Encrypted backup copies of your most critical passwords
- Credentials you access infrequently but can't afford to lose
- Sharing passwords securely with family members
- Recovery codes and security questions

This combination gives you the convenience of autofill for daily use plus a
secure, encrypted backup for your most important credentials that can be passed
on through Legacy.

### Should I store 2FA codes in Locker or Auth? {#locker-vs-auth}

Use **Ente Auth** for:

- TOTP codes (the 6-digit codes that change every 30 seconds)
- Any two-factor authentication secrets

Use **Locker** for:

- 2FA backup/recovery codes (the one-time codes you get when setting up 2FA)
- Security questions and answers
- Notes about account recovery options

Auth is specifically designed for TOTP and has features like quick code copying
and countdown timers. Locker is for static information that doesn't change.

### What is Locker NOT designed for? {#locker-limitations}

Locker is not intended as:

- **A primary password manager**: No browser autofill or extensions
- **Large file storage**: Has item and storage limits (100 items/1GB free)
- **A replacement for physical originals**: Keep original documents safe;
  Locker is for secure backup and quick access
- **Photo storage**: Use Ente Photos for photos and videos
- **2FA code generation**: Use Ente Auth for TOTP codes
