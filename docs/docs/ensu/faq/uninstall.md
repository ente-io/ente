    How to completely remove Ensu and its downloaded models from your device

# Uninstall Ensu

Uninstalling the Ensu app from your device removes the application itself, but
depending on your platform, the downloaded model files and local data may remain.
This page explains how to remove the downloaded models and local data.

## macOS

1. Quit Ensu if it is running.
2. Move **Ensu.app** from your Applications folder (or wherever you placed it)
   to the Trash.
3. Delete the application data folder:

    ```sh
    rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/io.ente.ensu
    ```

    This folder contains the downloaded model files (in a `models` subfolder),
    the local chat database, attachments, and logs.

## Windows

1. Uninstall Ensu using **Settings > Apps** (or **Add or Remove Programs**).
2. Delete the application data folder:

    ```
    %APPDATA%\io.ente.ensu
    ```

    You can paste this path into the File Explorer address bar. It contains the
    downloaded models, chat database, and logs.

## Linux

1. Remove the Ensu application (e.g. delete the AppImage or uninstall the
   package).
2. Delete the application data folder:

    ```sh
    rm -rf ~/.local/share/io.ente.ensu
    ```

    On some distributions this may instead be at the path given by
    `$XDG_DATA_HOME/io.ente.ensu`.

## iOS

Deleting the Ensu app from your Home Screen or through **Settings > General >
iPhone Storage** removes everything, including the downloaded model and all local
chat data. No additional cleanup is needed.

## Android

Uninstalling Ensu through your device settings or the Play Store removes the app
and its internal data (chat database, preferences). The downloaded model files
are stored in the app's external files directory and are also removed on
uninstall.

If you want to manually free space _without_ uninstalling, you can clear the
app's storage via **Settings > Apps > Ensu > Storage > Clear data**.

## Web

The web version of Ensu stores the model in the browser's Origin Private File
System (OPFS). To reclaim this space:

1. Open your browser's settings.
2. Find the site data for **ensu.ente.io**.
3. Delete it.

In Chrome, this is under **Settings > Privacy and security > Site settings >
View permissions and data stored across sites**. Search for `ensu.ente.io` and
click **Delete data**.
