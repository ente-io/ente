/**
 * Complete a multipart upload by reporting information about all the uploaded
 * parts to the provided {@link completionURL}.
 *
 * @param completionURL A pre-signed URL to which the final status of the
 * uploaded parts should be reported to.
 *
 * @param completedParts Information about all the parts of the file that have
 * been uploaded. The part numbers must start at 1 and must be consecutive.
 *
 * @param retrier A function to wrap the request in retries if needed.
 *
 * [Note: Multipart uploads]
 *
 * Multipart uploads are a mechanism to upload large files onto an remote
 * storage bucket by breaking it into smaller chunks / "parts", uploading each
 * part separately, and then reporting the consolidated information of all the
 * uploaded parts to a URL that marks the upload as complete on remote.
 *
 * This allows greater resilience since uploads of individual parts can be
 * retried independently without failing the entire upload on transient network
 * issues. This also helps self hosters, since often cloud providers have limits
 * to the size of single requests that they'll allow through (e.g. the
 * Cloudflare free plan currently has a 100 MB request size limit).
 *
 * The flow is implemented in two ways:
 *
 * a. The normal way, where each requests is made to a remote S3 bucket directly
 *    using the pre-signed URL.
 *
 * b. Using workers, where the requests are proxied via a worker near to the
 *    user's network to speed the requests up.
 *
 * See [Note: Faster uploads via workers] for more details on the worker flow.
 *
 * In both cases, the overall flow is roughly like the following:
 *
 * 1. Obtain multiple pre-signed URLs from remote (museum). The specific API
 *    call will be different (because of the different authentication
 *    mechanisms) when we're running in the context of the photos app
 *    ({@link fetchMultipartUploadURLs}) and when we're running in the context
 *    of the public albums app ({@link fetchPublicAlbumsMultipartUploadURLs}).
 *
 * 2. Break the file to be uploaded into parts, and upload each part using a PUT
 *    request to one of the pre-signed URLs we got in step 1. There are two
 *    variants of this - one where we directly upload to the remote (S3)
 *    ({@link putFilePart}), and one where we go via a worker
 *    ({@link putFilePartViaWorker}).
 *
 * 3. Once all the parts have been uploaded, send a consolidated report of all
 *    the uploaded parts (the step 2's) to remote via another pre-signed
 *    "completion URL" that we also got in step 1. Like step 2, there are 2
 *    variants of this - one where we directly tell the remote (S3)
 *    ({@link completeMultipartUpload}), and one where we report via a worker
 *    ({@link completeMultipartUploadViaWorker}).
