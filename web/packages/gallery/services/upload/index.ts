 *    resuming an interrupted upload of. Either ways, what we have is a tuple
 *    containing the (path to zip file, and the name of an entry within that zip
 *    file). This is the {@link ZipItem} case.

/**
 * An "path prefix"-like opaque string which can be used to disambiguate
 * distinct source {@link UploadItem}s with the same name that are meant to be
 * uploaded to the same destination Ente album.
 *
 * Th documentation of {@link UploadItem} describes the four cases that an
 * {@link UploadItem} can be. For each of these, we augment an
 * {@link UploadItem} with a prefix ("dirname") derived from its best "path":
 *
 * - Relative path or name in the case of web {@link File}s.
 *
 * - Absolute path in the case of desktop {@link File} or path or
 *   {@link FileAndPath}.
 *
 * - Path within the zip file for desktop {@link ZipItem}s.
 *
 * Thus, this path should not be treated as an address that can be used to
 * retrieve the upload item, but rather as extra context that can help us
 * distinguish between items by their relative or path prefix when their file
 * names are the same and they're being uploaded to the same album.
 *
 * Consider the following hierarchy:
 *
 *     Foo/2017/Album1/1.png
 *     Foo/2017/Album1/1.png.json
 *
 *     Foo/2020/Album1/1.png
 *     Foo/2020/Album1/1.png.json
 *
 * If user uploads `Foo`, irrespective of if they select the "root" or "parent"
 * option {@link CollectionMapping} option, when matching the takeout, only the
 * Ente album is considered. So it will be undefined which JSON will get used,
 * and both PNG files will get the same JSON, not their file system siblings.
 *
 * In such cases, the path prefix of the item being uploaded can act as extra
 * context that can help us disambiguate and pick the sibling. Note how we don't
 * need the path prefix to be absolute or relative or even addressable, we just
 * need it as extra context that can help us disambiguate two items with
 * otherwise the same name and that are destined for the same Ente album.
 *
 * So for our example, the path prefixes will be
 *
 *     Foo/2017/Album1/1.png          "Foo/2017/Album1"
 *     Foo/2017/Album1/1.png.json     "Foo/2017/Album1"
 *
 *     Foo/2020/Album1/1.png          "Foo/2020/Album1"
 *     Foo/2020/Album1/1.png.json     "Foo/2020/Album1"
 *
 * And can thus be used to associate the correct metadata JSON with the
 * corresponding {@link UploadItem}.
 *
 * As a special case, "/metadata" at the end of the path prefix is discarded.
 * This allows the metadata JSON written by export to be read back in during
 * uploads. See: [Note: Fold "metadata" directory into parent folder].
