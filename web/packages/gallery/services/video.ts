 *
 * [Note: Caching HLS playlist data]
 *
 * The playlist data can be cached in an asymmetric manner.
 *
 * - If a file has a corresponding HLS playlist, then currently there is no
 *   scenario (apart from file deletion, where the playlist also gets deleted)
 *   where the playlist is updated or deleted after being created. There is a
 *   limit to the validity of the presigned chunk URLs within the playlist we
 *   create which we do handle (`createHLSPlaylistItemDataValidity`), but the
 *   original playlist itself does not change. In particular, a positive result
 *   ("this file has a playlist") can be cached indefinitely.
 *
 * - If a file does not have a HLS playlist, and it is eligible for being
 *   streamed (e.g. it is not too small where the streaming overhead is not
 *   required), then a client (this one, or a different one) can process it at
 *   any arbitrary time. So the negative result ("this file does not have a
 *   playlist") cannot be cached.
 *
 * So while we can easily cache the first case ("this file has a playlist"), we
 * need to deal with the second case ("this file does not have a playlist") a
 * bit more intricately:
 *
 * - If running in the context of a logged in user (e.g. photos app), we can use
 *   the "/files/data/status-diff" API to be notified of any modifications to
 *   the second case for the user's own files. This status-diff happens during
 *   the regular "sync", and we can use that as a cue to selectively prune cache
 *   entries for the second case (but can otherwise indefinitely cache it).
 *
 * - If the file is a shared file, the status-diff will not return it. And if
 *   we're not running in the context of a logged in user (e.g. the public
 *   albums app), then there is no status-diff to do. For these two scenarios,
 *   we thus mark the cached values as "transient" and always recheck for a
 *   playlist when opening the slide.

    // - A URI line identifies a media segment.

    // - The EXTINF tag specifies the duration of the media segment (applies
    //   only to the next URI line that follows it in the playlist).
    //
    // - The EXT-X-BYTERANGE tag indicates that a media segment is a sub-range
    //   of the resource identified by its URI (applies only to the next URI
    //   line that follows it in the playlist). The value should be of the
    //   format `<n>[@<o>]` where n is an integer indicating the length of the
    //   sub-range in bytes, and if present, o is the integer indicating the
    //   start of the sub-range as a byte offset from the beginning of the
    //   resource. If o is not present, the sub-range begins at the next byte
    //   following the sub-range of the previous media segment.
    //
    // - Media segments may be encrypted, and the EXT-X-KEY tag specifies how to
    //   decrypt them. It applies to all subsequent media segment (until another
    //   EXT-X-KEY). Value is an `<attribute-list>`, consisting of the METHOD
    //   (AES-128 for us), URI and IV attributes. The URI attribute value is a
    //   quoted string containing a URI that specifies how to obtain the key.
