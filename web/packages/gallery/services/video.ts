 *
 * [Note: Caching HLS playlist data]
 *
 * The playlist data can be cached in an asymmetric manner.
 *
 * - If a file has a corresponding HLS playlist, then currently there is no
 *   scenario (apart from file deletion, where the playlist also gets deleted)
 *   where the playlist is deleted after being created. There is a limit to the
 *   validity of the pre-signed chunk URLs within the playlist we create (which
 *   we do handle, see `createHLSPlaylistItemDataValidity`), but the original
 *   playlist itself does not change. Updates are technically possible, but
 *   apart from a misbehaving client, are not expected (and should be no-ops in
 *   the rare cases they happen, since effectively same playlist should get
 *   regenerated again). All in all, this means that a positive result ("this
 *   file has a playlist") can be cached indefinitely.
 *
 * - If a file does not have a HLS playlist, it might be because it is not
 *   eligible for being streamed (e.g. it is already small and in a compatible
 *   codec). See [Note: Marking files which do not need video processing] for
 *   more details of this case. In particular, we can cache this state in memory
 *   indefinitely too, since there isn't a current case where either this
 *   eligibility can change, or the client gain the ability to handle them
 *   without restarting.
 *
 * - Finally, if a file does not have an HLS playlist but and it is eligible for
 *   being streamed, then a client (this one, or a different one) can process it
 *   at any arbitrary time. So the negative result ("this file does not have a
 *   playlist") cannot be cached.
 *
 * So while we can easily cache the first case ("this file has a playlist") and
 * second case ("this file doesn't need a streaming variant"), we need to deal
 * with the third case ("this file does not have a playlist") by marking the
 * cached values as "transient" and always recheck for a playlist when opening
 * the slide.

    // - The EXTINF tag specifies the duration of the media segment (applies

    // - The EXT-X-BYTERANGE tag indicates that a media segment is a sub-range
    //   of the resource identified by its URI (applies only to the next URI
    //   line that follows it in the playlist). The value should be of the
    //   format `<n>[@<o>]` where n is an integer indicating the length of the
    //   sub-range in bytes, and if present, o is the integer indicating the
    //   start of the sub-range as a byte offset from the beginning of the
    //   resource. If o is not present, the sub-range begins at the next byte
    //   following the sub-range of the previous media segment.
    //
    // - Media segments may be encrypted, and the EXT-X-KEY tag specifies how to
    //   decrypt them. It applies to all subsequent media segment (until another
    //   EXT-X-KEY). Value is an `<attribute-list>`, consisting of the METHOD
    //   (AES-128 for us), URI and IV attributes. The URI attribute value is a
    //   quoted string containing a URI that specifies how to obtain the key.

    // make API requests), and then provide this pre-signed URL to the node side
