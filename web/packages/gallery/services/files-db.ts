/**
 * @file
 *
 * [Note: Files DB]
 *
 * Prior to us using idb for accessing IndexedDB, we used localForage (another
 * IndexedDB library) for that purpose (See `docs/storage.md` for more context).
 *
 * Our use of localForage was (and is) limited to:
 *
 * - A single IndexedDB database named "ente-files" containing
 *
 *   - A single table named "files"
 *
 * It stored more than files though - files, collections, trash, their
 * corresponding sync times, and other bits and bobs related to them.
 *
 * Since we've now switched to idb as our preferred IndexedDB library, the data
 * stored in this files table could be considered legacy in a sense. But such
 * would be an incorrect characterization - this code has no issues, and it
 * stores core data for us (files and collections are as core as it gets).
 *
 * So this table is not legacy or deprecated, and there is currently no strong
 * reason to migrate this data to another IndexedDB table (it works fine as it
 * is, really). However we do want to avoid adding more items here, and maybe
 * gradually move some of the "bits and bobs" elsewhere (e.g. KV DB).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * This file contains the common code and types. Application layer code should
 * usually be accessing the app specific files DB by importing the functions
 * from the following modules:
 *
 * - Photos app: `photos-fdb.ts`
 * - Public albums app: `public-albums-fdb.ts`
 *
 * Note that even though both of them refer to the same conceptual "files DB",
 * the actual storage is distinct since both the apps run on separate domains
 * and so have their separate IndexedDB storage.
 *
 * Still, the key names are (generally) distinct to reduce chances of confusion.

/**
 * Apply transformations when reading files from the DB.
 *
 * There are two parts to it -
 *
 * 1. the required part (patching old entries that might be present in the local
 *    database),
 * 2. the optional part (removing some unused fields).
 *
 * Part 1 ---
 *
 * Transform metadata in legacy files that might be present in the local
 * database. Note that this will not be needed for files that are fetched
 * afresh, since the corresponding transform is already done during
 * {@link decryptRemoteFile}; this is only for handling potentially items that
 * might've been already present locally.
 *
 * Part 2 ---
 *
 * Remove unused fields from the file objects when reading them.
 *
 * This is similar to the transformation we perform when reading collections
 * from the database, to discard fields that are no longer forwarded when we
 * parse the remote object, and thus will not be present in the local DB either
 * when going forward. They might be present for the existing entries in DB
 * though, which is why these functions are needed.
 *
 * However, since unlike collections, we don't route the files through Zod when
 * reading. So instead we do it using this function. Effectively, the end result
 * should be the same. In any case, doing this cleanup has no functional impact.
 *
 * Both parts added June 2025, 1.7.14-beta, prune eventually (tag: Migration).
