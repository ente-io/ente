/**
 * [Note: Collection file]

 * File IDs themselves are unique across all the files for the user (in fact,
 * they're unique across all the files in an Ente instance).
 *
 * However, we can have multiple entries for the same file ID in our local
 * database and/or remote responses because the unit of account is not file, but
 * a "Collection File" â€“ a collection and file pair.
 *
 * For example, if the same file is symlinked into two collections, then we will
 * have two "Collection File" entries for it, both with the same file ID, but
 * with different collection IDs.
 *
 * This function returns files such that only one of these entries is returned.
 * The entry that is returned is arbitrary in general, this function just picks
 * the first one for each unique file ID.
 *
 * If this function is invoked on a list on which {@link sortFiles} has already
 * been called, which by default sorts such that the newest file is first, then
 * this function's behaviour would be to return the newest file from among
 * multiple files with the same ID but different collections.
