## ente-gallery

A package for sharing code between our apps that show media (photos, videos) in
a gallery like view.

Specifically, this is the intersection of code required by both the photos and
public albums apps.

### Packaging

This (internal) package exports a React TypeScript library. We rely on the
importing project to transpile and bundle it.
