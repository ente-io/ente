         * [Note: Media chrome focus workaround]
         *
         * The media-chrome-button elements (e.g, the play button, but also
         * others, including the menu) retain focus after clicking on them.
         * e.g., if I click the "media-mute-button" to activate it, then the
         * mute button grabs focus (but not :focus-visible). So it doesn't
         * appear focused visually, but then later if I press Space or Enter,
         * then the mute button activates again instead of toggling video
         * playback (as our keyboard shortcut is meant to do).
         *
         * I'm not sure who is at fault here, but this behaviour ends up being
         * irritating. e.g. say I change the quality in the menu, and press
         * space to play - well, the space no longer works because the media
         * chrome has grabbed focus and instead activates itself, reopening the
         * settings menu.
         *
         * As a workaround, we ask media chrome to drop focus on mouse clicks.
         * This should not impact keyboard activations.
         *
         * This workaround is likely to cause problems in the future, but I
         * can't find a better way short of upstream media chrome changes.
