 *   video component, then fetching the image component.
 *
 * At this point, the data for this file will be considered final, and
 * subsequent calls for the same file will return this same value unless it is
 * invalidated.
 *
 * If at any point an error occurs, we reset our cache for this file so that the
 * next time the data is requested we repeat the process instead of continuing
