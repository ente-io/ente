 *
 * Exif is now commonly used as a synedoche for all forms of metadata that gets
 * embedded in a file, and this is also how we use the term. So these functions
 * extract and operate on not just Exif tags, but also XMP (XML metadata
 * embedded in images) and IPTC (another metadat standard) tags.
 *
 * A list for metadata tags can be found in exiftool's documentation:

 *
 * [Note: Exif dates]
 *
 * The most important bit we usually wish out of Exif is the date and time when
 * the photo was taken. The Exif specification has the following tags related to
 * photo's date:
 *
 * - DateTimeOriginal
 * - DateTimeDigitized (aka "CreateDate")
 * - DateTime (aka "ModifyDate")
 *
 * DateTimeOriginal is meant to signify best when the original image was taken,
 * and we use it as the photo's creation date whenever it is present. If not, we
 * fallback to DateTimeDigitized or DateTime (in that order).
 *
 * Each of these is a string of the format
 *
 *     YYYY:MM:DD HH:mm:ss
 *
 * where
 *
 *     YYYY  4 digit (zero padded) year
 *     MM    2 digit (zero padded) month, with Jan as 01 and Dec as 12.
 *     DD    2 digit (zero padded) day of the month (1 to 31)
 *     HH    2 digit (zero padded) hours since midnight (00 to 23)
 *     mm    2 digit (zero padded) minutes (00 to 59)
 *     ss    2 digit (zero padded) seconds (00 to 59)
 *
 * Additionally (and optionally), there are three SubSecTime* tags that provide
 * the fractional seconds (one for each of the above):
 *
 * - SubSecTimeOriginal
 * - SubSecTimeDigitized
 * - SubSecTime
 *
 * Each of which is a string specifying the fractional digits.
 *
 * The dates are all in the local time of the place where the photo was taken.
 * To convert these to UTC, we also need to know the offset from UTC of that
 * local time. This is provided by the three OffsetTime* tags (one for each of
 * the above):
 *
 * - OffsetTimeOriginal
 * - OffsetTimeDigitized
 * - OffsetTime
 *
 * Each of these is a string of the format
 *
 *     ±HH:mm
 *
 * denoting the signed hour and minute offset from UTC.
 *
 * Note that these OffsetTime* tags are relatively new additions (prior to
 * smartphones, cameras did not have a good way of knowing their TZ), and most
 * old photos will not have this information. In such cases, we assume that
 * these photos are in the local time where this code is running. This is
 * manifestly going to be incorrect in some cases, but it is a better assumption
 * than assuming UTC, which, while deterministic, is going to incorrect in an
 * overwhelming majority of cases.

 *
 * @return A JSON object containing the raw exif and other metadata that was

 *
 * ---
 *
 * [Note: Defining "raw" Exif]
 *
 * We wish for a canonical "raw" JSON representing all the Exif data associated
 * with a file. This goal is tricky to achieve because:
 *
 * - While Exif itself is a standard, with a standard set of tags (a numeric
 *   id), in practice vendors can use tags more than what are currently listed
 *   in the standard.
 *
 * - We're not just interested in Exif tags, but rather at all forms of metadata
 *   (e.g. XMP, IPTC) that can be embedded in a file.
 *
 * By default, the library we use (ExifReader) returns a merged object
 * containing all tags it understands from all forms of metadata that it knows
 * about.
 *
 * Since it only returns the tags it understands, it acts an an implicit
 * whitelist. This implicit whitelist behaviour can be turned off by specifying
 * the `includeUnknown` flag, but for our case it is useful since it acts as a
 * safeguard against extracting an unbounded amounts of data (for example, there
 * is an Exif tag for thumbnails. While we specifically filter out that
 * particular tag, it is not hard to imagine some other unforseen vendor
 * specific tag containing a similarly large amounts of embedded data).
 *
 * So we keep the default behaviour of returning only the tags that the library
 * knows about. Luckily for us, it returns all the XMP tags even if this flag is
 * specified, and that is one place where we'd like unknown tags so that we can
 * selectively start adding support for them.
 *
 * The other default behaviour, of returning a merged object, is a bit more
 * problematic for our use case, since it loses information. Thus, to keep
 * things more deterministic, we specify the `expanded` flag which returns all
 * these different forms of metadata separately.
 *
 * That's for the tags we get. Now to their contents. Generally for each tag
 * (but not for always), we get an entry with an "id", "value" (e.g. the raw
 * bytes), and a "description" (which is the raw data parsed to a form that is
 * more usable). Technically speaking, the value is the raw data we want, but in
 * some cases, the availability of a pre-parsed description will be convenient
 * too. So we don't prune anything, and keep all three.
 *
 * All this means we end up with a JSON whose exact structure is tied to the
 * library we're using (ExifReader), or even its version (the library reserves
 * the right to change the formatting of the "description" fields in minor
 * version updates).
 *
 * So this is not really "raw" Exif. But with that caveat out of the way,
 * practically this should be raw enough given the tradeoffs mentioned above,
 * while allowing us to consume this JSON in arbitrary clients without needing
 * to know about ExifReader specifically.
