 * We maintain a "changelog version". This version is an incrementing positive
 * integer, we increment it whenever we want to show this dialog again. Usually
 * we'd do this for each app update, but not necessarily.
 *
 * The "What's new" dialog is shown when the saved changelog version is less
 * than the current {@link changelogVersion}.
 *
 * The shown changelog version is saved on the Node.js layer since there we can
 * store it in the user preferences store, which is not cleared on logout.
 *
 * On app start, we read the last saved version:
 *
 * - If it is not present, we set it to the current version _without_ showing
 *   the what's new dialog. This is to handle fresh installs.
 *
 * - If it is present and less than the current version, we show the what's new
 *   dialog. Otherwise do nothing.
 *
 * The what's new dialog sets the saved version to the current one whenever it
 * is shown.
