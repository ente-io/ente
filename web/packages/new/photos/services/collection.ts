/**
 * Remove the given files from the specified collection owned by the user.
 *
 * Reads local state but does not modify it. The effects are on remote.
 *
 * @param collection A collection (either owned by the user, or shared with the
 * user).
 *
 * @param files The files to remove from the collection. The files owned by the
 * user will be removed. If the collection is not owned by the user, then any
 * files that are not owned by the user will not be processed. In such cases,
 * this function will return a count less than the count of the provided files
 * (after having removed what can be removed).
 *
 * @returns The count of files that were processed. This can be less than the
 * count of the provided {@link files} if some files were not processed because
 * because they belong to other users (and {@link collection} also does not
 * belong to the current user).
 *
 * [Note: Removing files from a collection]
 *
 * There are three scenarios
 *
 *                             own file      shared file
 *     own collection             M               R
 *     others collection          R         not supported
 *
 *     M (move)   when both collection and file belongs to user
 *     R (remove) when only one of them belongs to the user
 *
 * The move operation is not supported across ownership boundaries. The remove
 * operation is only supported across ownership boundaries, but the user should
 * have ownership of either the file or collection (not both).
 *
 * In more detail, the above three scenarios can be described this way.
 *
 * 1. Move: If the user owns both the collection and the file they're trying to
 *    remove from the collection, then instead of a remove the client needs to
 *    move it to a different user owned collection in which it already exists
 *    (such a move acts as a remove). If it doesn't exist in any other user
 *    owned collection, then move it to the user's "Uncategorized" collection.
 *    The intent is that a "remove from collection" should not remove the last
 *    copy of a file (thus deleting it).
 *
 * 2. Remove: If the user does not own the file being removed, or owns the file
 *    being removed but does not own the collection from which it is being
 *    removed, they can remove it from the collection using the POST
 *    "/collections/v3/remove-files".
 *
 * 3. Not supported: Currently the possibility of removing a file the user does
 *    not own from a collection that the user does not own, even if they are a
 *    collaborator, is not supported.
 *
 * The "remove from collection" primitive is provided to the user both as a UI
 * action (on selecting files in a collection), and as an implicit action if the
 * user chooses the option to "keep files" when deleting a collection.
 *
 * This entire shebang is implemented by the following set of functions:
 *
 * 1. [Public] {@link removeFromCollection} - Handles both own and others
 *    collections by delegating to the one of the following functions.
 *
 * 2. [Public] {@link removeFromOwnCollection} - Handles both cases for own
 *    collections by delegating to either "Move" or "Remove"
 *
 * 3. [Private] {@link removeFromOthersCollection} - Handles both cases for
 *    other's collections by delegating to "Remove", then if needed, also
 *    throwing an error for the unsupported case.
 *
 * 4. [Private] {@link removeOwnFilesFromOwnCollection} implements the "Move".
 *
 * 5. [Private] {@link removeNonCollectionOwnerFiles} implements the "Remove".
