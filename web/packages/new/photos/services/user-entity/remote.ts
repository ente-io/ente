/**
 * The maximum number of items to fetch in a single diff
 *
 * [Note: Limit of returned items in /diff requests]
 *
 * The various GET /diff API methods, which tell the client what all has changed
 * since a timestamp (provided by the client) take a limit parameter.
 *
 * These diff API calls return all items whose updated at is greater
 * (non-inclusive) than the timestamp we provide. So there is no mechanism for
 * pagination of items which have the exact same updated at.
 *
 * Conceptually, it may happen that there are more items than the limit we've
 * provided, but there are practical safeguards.
 *
 * For file diff, the limit is advisory, and remote may return less, equal or
 * more items than the provided limit. The scenario where it returns more is
 * when more files than the limit have the same updated at. Theoretically it
 * would make the diff response unbounded, however in practice file
 * modifications themselves are all batched. Even if the user were to select all
 * the files in their library and updates them all in one go in the UI, their
 * client app is required (with server side enforcement) to use batched API
 * calls to make those updates. Thus, each of those batches would get distinct
 * updated at values.
 *
 * For entity diff, there are no bulk operations yet that can result in the
 * assignment of the same microsecond to hundreds of items.

 *
 * Unlike git diffs which track all changes, the diffs we get from remote are

 *
 * For example, in a user entity diff, it is guaranteed that there will only be
 * at max one entry for a particular entity id. The entry will have no data to
 * indicate that the corresponding entity was deleted. Otherwise, when the data
 * is present, it is taken as the creation of a new entity or the updation of an
 * existing one.
 *
 * This behaviour comes from how remote stores the underlying, say, entities. A
 * diff returns just entities whose updation times greater than the provided
 * since time (limited to the given diff limit). So there will be at most one
 * row for a particular entity id. And if that entity has been deleted, then the
 * row will be a tombstone, so data be absent.
