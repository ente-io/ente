 * Sync our local state with remote on page load for web and focus for desktop.

 * This function makes various API calls to fetch state from remote, using it to
 * update our local state, and triggering periodic jobs that depend on the local
 * state.
 *
 * This runs on initial page load (on both web and desktop). In addition for
 * desktop, it also runs each time the desktop app gains focus.
 *
 * TODO: This is called after we've synced the local files DBs with remote. That
 * code belongs here, but currently that state is persisted in the top level
 * gallery React component.
 *
 * So meanwhile we've split this sync into this method, which is called after
 * the file info has been synced (which can take a few minutes for large
 * libraries after initial login), and the `preFileInfoSync`, which is called
 * before doing the file sync and thus should run immediately after login.

 * changes to match remote).
 *
 * A bespoke version of this in currently used by the gallery component when it
 * syncs - it needs a broken down, bespoke version because it also keeps local
 * state variables that need to be updated with the various callbacks that we
