/**
 * Called during a full sync, before doing the collection and file sync.
 *
 * [Note: Remote sync]
 *
 * There are two types of remote syncs we perform:
 *
 * - A "collection and file" sync: Syncing our local state of collections and
 *   files with remote.
 *
 * - A "full" sync, which includes the collection and file sync, and more.
 *
 * The full sync is performed by the gallery page, in the following sequence:
 *
 * 1. {@link preCollectionAndFilesSync}
 * 2. {@link syncCollectionAndFiles}
 * 3. {@link postCollectionAndFilesSync}.
 *
 * In some other cases, where we know that only specific collection and/or file
 * state needs to be synced, step 2 ({@link syncCollectionAndFiles}) is
 * performed independently. The only example of such a cases currently is:
 *
 * - After deduping files.
 *
 * The full sync is performed in the following cases:
 *
 * - On the gallery page load (for both web and desktop).
 * - Every 5 minutes thereafter (while the user is on the gallery page).
 * - Each time the desktop app gains focus.
 * - When the file viewer is closed after performing some operation.
