 *
 * On the other hand, saving the face index to remote might fail for transient

 * file which is preventing the index from being saved. What exactly? We don't
 * know, but the possibility exists.

 * To reduce the chances of this happening, we treat HTTP 4xx responses as

 * client might get a non-retriable 4xx (e.g. if the file has over ~700 faces,
