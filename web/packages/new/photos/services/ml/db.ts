/**
 * ML DB schema.
 *
 * The "ML" database is made of the lower level "index" object stores, and
 * higher level "cluster" object stores.
 *
 * The index related object stores are the following:
 *
 * - "file-status": Contains {@link FileStatus} objects, one for each
 *   {@link EnteFile} that the ML subsystem knows about. Periodically (and when
 *   required), this is synced with the list of files that the current client
 *   knows about locally.
 *
 * - "face-index": Contains {@link LocalFaceIndex} objects, either indexed
 *   locally or fetched from remote.
 *
 * - "clip-index": Contains {@link LocalCLIPIndex} objects, either indexed
 *   locally or fetched from remote.
 *
 * These three stores are keyed by {@link fileID}. The "file-status" contains
 * book-keeping about the indexing process (whether or not a file needs
 * indexing, or if there were errors doing so), while the other stores contain
 * the actual indexing results.
 *
 * In tandem, these serve as the underlying storage for the indexes maintained
 * in the ML database.
 *
 * The face clustering related object stores are the following:
 *
 * - "face-cluster": Contains {@link FaceCluster} objects, one for each cluster
 *   of faces that either the clustering algorithm produced locally. It is
 *   indexed by the cluster ID.
