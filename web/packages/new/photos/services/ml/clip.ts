 *
 * [Note: Natural language search using CLIP]
 *
 * CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) is a neural network trained on
 * (image, text) pairs. It can be thought of as two separate (but jointly
 * trained) encoders - one for images, and one for text - that both map to the
 * same embedding space.
 *
 * We use this for natural language search (aka "magic search") within the app:
 *
 * 1. Pre-compute an embedding for each image.
 *
 * 2. When the user searches, compute an embedding for the search term.
 *
 * 3. Use cosine similarity to find the find the image (embedding) closest to
 *    the text (embedding).
 *
 * More details are in our [blog
 * post](https://ente.io/blog/image-search-with-clip-ggml/) that describes the
 * initial launch of this feature using the GGML runtime.
 *
 * Since the initial launch, we've switched over to another runtime,
 * [ONNX](https://onnxruntime.ai), started using Apple's
 * [MobileCLIP](https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip/) as the model and have
 * made other implementation changes, but the overall gist remains the same.
 *
 * Note that we don't train the neural network - we only use one of the publicly
 * available pre-trained neural networks for inference. These neural networks
 * are wholly defined by their connectivity and weights. ONNX, our ML runtimes,
 * loads these weights and instantiates a running network that we can use to
 * compute the embeddings.
 *
 * Theoretically, the same CLIP model can be loaded by different frameworks /
 * runtimes, but in practice each runtime has its own preferred format, and
 * there are also quantization tradeoffs. So there is a specific model (a binary
 * encoding of weights) tied to our current runtime that we use.
 *
 * To ensure that the embeddings, for the most part, can be shared, whenever
 * possible we try to ensure that all the preprocessing steps, and the model
 * itself, is the same across clients - web and mobile.
