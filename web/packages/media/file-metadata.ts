/**
 * Information about the file that never changes post upload.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * [Note: Metadatum]
 *
 * There are three different sources of metadata relating to a file.
 *
 * 1. Metadata
 * 2. Magic metadata
 * 3. Public magic metadata
 *
 * The names of API entities are such for historical reasons, but we can think
 * of them as:
 *
 * 1. Metadata
 * 2. Private mutable metadata
 * 3. Public mutable metadata
 *
 * Metadata is the original metadata that we attached to the file when it was
 * uploaded. It is immutable, and it never changes.
 *
 * Later on, the user might make changes to the file's metadata. Since the
 * metadata is immutable, we need a place to keep these mutations.
 *
 * Some mutations are "private" to the user who owns the file. For example, the
 * user might archive the file. Such modifications get written to (2), Private
 * Mutable Metadata.
 *
 * Other mutations are "public" across all the users with whom the file is
 * shared. For example, if the user (owner) edits the name of the file, all
 * people with whom this file is shared can see the new edited name. Such
 * modifications get written to (3), Shared Mutable Metadata.
 *
 * When the client needs to show a file, it needs to "merge" in two or three of
 * these sources (nb: remote will only send the permissible ones):
 *
 * - When showing a shared file, (1) and (3) are merged, with changes from (3)
 *   taking precedence, to obtain the full metadata pertinent to the file.
 *
 * - When showing a normal (un-shared) file, (1), (2) and (3) are merged, with
 *   changes from (2) and (3) taking precedence, to obtain the full metadata.
 *   (2) and (3) have no intersection of keys, so they can be merged in any
 *   order.
 *
 * While these sources can be conceptually merged, it is important for the
 * client to also retain the original sources unchanged. This is because the
 * metadatas (any of the three) might have keys that the current client does not
 * yet understand, so when updating some key, say filename in (3), it should
 * only edit the key it knows about but retain the rest of the source JSON
 * unchanged.
 *
 * A similar concept applies to collections, which can (like files) have
 * metadata associated with them with varying axis of mutability and access.
 *
 * Collections also have another type of metadata.
 *
 * 4. Shared magic metadata
 *
 * which in our hypothetical naming scheme can be thought of as
 *
 * 4. Per-sharee private mutable metadata
 *
 * This is "magic metadata" associated with each share. Each user with whom the
 * collection has been shared with can use it store metadata (e.g. archive
 * status) that is private to them, and can only be edited by them. For more
 * details on this type of metadata, see [Note: Share specific metadata].

 * [Note: Photos are always in local date/time]
 *
 * Photos out in the wild frequently do not have associated timezone offsets for

 * cameras didn't know often even know their date/time correctly, let alone the
 * UTC offset of their local data/time.
 *
 * This is beginning to change with smartphone cameras, and is even reflected in
 * the standards. e.g. Exif metadata now has auxiliary "OffsetTime*" tags for
 * indicating the UTC offset of the local date/time in the existing Exif tags
 * (See: [Note: Exif dates]).
 *
 * So a photos app needs to deal with a mixture of photos whose dates may or may
 * not have UTC offsets. This is fact #1.
 *
 * Users expect to see the time they took the photo, not the time in the place
 * they are currently. People expect a New Year's Eve photo from a vacation to
 * show up as midnight, not as (e.g.) 19:30 IST. This is fact #2.
 *
 * Combine these two facts, and if you ponder a bit, you'll find that there is
 * only one way for a photos app to show / sort / label the date – by using the
 * local date/time without the attached UTC offset, **even if it is present**.
 *
 * The UTC offset is still useful though, and we don't want to lose that
 * information. The number of photos with a UTC offset will only increase. And
 * whenever it is present, it provides additional context for the user.
 *
 * So we keep both the local date/time string (an ISO 8601 string guaranteed to
 * be without an associated UTC offset), and an (optional) UTC offset string.
 *
 * It is important to NOT think of the local date/time string as an instant of
 * time that can be converted to a UTC timestamp. It cannot be converted to a
 * UTC timestamp because while it itself might have the optional associated UTC
 * offset, its siblings photos might not. The only way to retain their
 * comparability is to treat them all the "time zone where the photo was taken".
 *
 * All this is good, but we still need to retain the existing `creationTime` UTC
 * epoch timestamp because in some cases when importing photos from other
 * providers, that's all we get. We could try and convert that to a date/time
 * string too, but since we anyways need to handle existing code that deals with

/**

 * These dates are all hypothetically in the timezone of the place where the
 * photo was taken. Different photos might've been taken in different timezones,
 * which is why it is hypothetical, so concretely these are all mapped to the
 * current timezone.
 *
 * The difference is subtle, but we should not think of these as absolute points
 * on the UTC timeline. They are instead better thought of as dates without an
 * associated timezone. For the purpose of mapping them all to a comparable
 * dimension them we all contingently use the current timezone - this makes it
 * easy to use JavaScript Date constructor which assumes that any date/time
 * string without an associated timezone is in the current timezone.
 *
 * Whenever we're surfacing them in the UI, or using them for grouping (say by
 * day), we should use their current timezone representation, not the UTC one.
