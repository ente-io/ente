 *
 *   A collection of type "folder" is created by the mobile app if there is an
 *   associated on-device album for the new Ente album being created.
 *
 *   This separation between "album" and "folder" allows different mobile
 *   clients to push to the same Folder ("Camera", "Screenshots"), not allowing
 *   for duplicate folders with the same name, while still allowing users to
 *   create different albums with the same name.
 *
 *   The web/desktop app does not create collections of type "folder", and
 *   otherwise treats them as aliases for "album".
 *
 * - "favorites" - A special collection consisting of the items that the user
 *   has marked as their favorites.
 *
 *   The user can have at most one collection of type "favorites" (enforced at
 *   remote). This collection is created on demand by the client where the user
 *   first marks an item as a favorite. The user can choose to share their
 *   "favorites" with other users, so it is possible for there to be multiple
 *   collections of type "favorites" present in our local database, however only
 *   one of those will belong to the logged in user (cf `owner.id`).
 *
 * - "uncategorized" - A special collection consisting of items that do not
 *   belong to any other collection.
 *
 *   In the remote schema, each item ({@link EnteFile}) is always associated
 *   with a collection. The same item may belong to multiple collections (See:
 *   [Note: Collection file]), but it must belong to at least one collection.
 *
 *   In some scenarios, e.g. when deleting the last collection to which a file
 *   belongs, the file would thus get orphaned and violate the schema
 *   invariants. So in such cases, the client which is performing the
 *   corresponding operation moves the file to the user's special
 *   "uncategorized" collection, creating it if needed.
 *
 *   Similar to "favorites", the user can have only one "uncategorized"
 *   collection. However, unlike "favorites", the "uncategorized" collection

 *
 * When a collection is shared with a particular user, then remote creates a new
 * "share" entity defined by the (collectionID, fromUserID, toUserID) tuple
 * (this entity is not exposed to us directly, but it is helpful to know the
 * underlying implementation for this discussion).
 *
 * Remote also allows us to store mutable metadata (aka "magic metadata") with
 * each such share entity. This effectively acts as a private space where each
 * user with whom a collection has been shared can store and mutate metadata
 * about this shared collection without affecting either the owner or other
 * users with whom the collection has been shared.
