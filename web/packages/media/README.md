## ente-media

A package for sharing code between our apps that show media (photos, videos).

Specifically, this is the intersection of code required by both the photos app
(or the public albums app) and cast apps.

### Packaging

This (internal) package exports a React TypeScript library. We rely on the
importing project to transpile and bundle it.
