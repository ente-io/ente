/**
 * A File.
 *
 * An EnteFile represents a file in Ente. It does not contain the actual data.
 *
 * It is named with an "Ente" prefix to disambiguate it from the web's native
 * {@link File} type.
 *
 * All files have an id (numeric) that is unique across all the files stored by
 * an Ente instance. Each file is also always associated with a collection, and
 * has an owner (both of these linkages are stored as the corresponding numeric
 * IDs within the EnteFile structure).
 *
 * > For shared files, the owner of the file is not necessarily the owner of all
 * > the collections to which the file belongs.
 *
 * While the file ID is unique, we'd can still have multiple entries for each
 * file ID in our local state, one for each {@link Collection} to which the file
 * belongs. That is, the uniqueness is across the (fileID, collectionID) pairs.
 * See [Note: Collection file].
 *
 * [Note: File lifecycle]
 *
 * 1. **Normal**: A file starts off by belonging to at least one collection. It
 *    can then be added to additional collections, each of which will be an
 *    EnteFile with a distinct (fileID, collectionID) pair.
 *
 * 2. **Trash**: If the user deletes the file, then the file moves to trash.
 *    Such files will have {@link isDeleted} `true` in their
 *    {@link RemoteEnteFile} entries when we perform a collection diff to let
 *    the client know that the corresponding file is no longer part of the
 *    collection.
 *
 *    Such files will now be returned as part of the trash diff, with both
 *    {@link isDeleted} and {@link isRestored} set to `false` for their trash
 *    entry.
 *
 * 3. **Restore**: If the the user were to restore the file before permanent
 *    deletion, then it effectively works as moving a normal file to an normal
 *    collection. In particular, if we were to restore the file back to one of
 *    the collections it was part of pre-trash, and then fetch the collection
 *    diff for that collection, we would get back the same file object, except
 *    with {@link isDeleted} will now be `false`.
 *
 *    The trash entry for restored files will have {@link isRestored} set to
 *    `true` to notify clients that an item that was previously in trash is no
 *    longer there because it has been restored.
 *
 * 4. **Permanent deletion**: If the file remains in trash for 30 days, or if
 *    the user explictly permanently deletes it from the trash, or if the user
 *    explicitly clears the trash, then it will get permanently deleted.
 *
 *    The trash entry for such permanently deleted files will have
 *    {@link isDeleted} set to `true` to notify clients that an item that was
 *    previously in trash is no longer there because it has been permanently
 *    deleted.
 *
 *    When a file is permanently deleted, remote will scrub off data from its
 *    fields. See: [Note: Optionality of remote file fields].

     * handling missing {@link encryptedData} of the {@link RemoteEnteFile}'s
     * {@link metadata} field in such cases. We could mark it as a optional too,
