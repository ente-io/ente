 *
 * This cache is suitable for storing large amounts of data (entire files).
 *
 * To obtain a cache for a given namespace, use {@link openBlobCache}. To clear all
 * cached data (e.g. during logout), use {@link clearBlobCaches}.
 *
 * [Note: Caching files]
 *
 * The underlying implementation of the cache is different depending on the
 * runtime environment.
 *
 * * The preferred implementation, and the one that is used when we're running
 *   in a browser, is to use the standard [Web
 *   Cache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache).
 *
 * * However when running under Electron (when this code runs as part of our
 *   desktop app), a custom OPFS based cache is used instead. This is because
 *   Electron currently doesn't support using standard Web Cache API for data
 *   served by a custom protocol handler (See this
 *   [issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/35033), and the
 *   underlying restriction that comes from
 *   [Chromium](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/blink/renderer/modules/cache_storage/cache.cc;l=83-87?q=%22Request%20scheme%20%27%22&ss=chromium))
 *
 * [OPFS](https://web.dev/articles/origin-private-file-system) stands for Origin
 * Private File System. It is a recent API that allows a web site to store
 * reasonably large amounts of data. One option (that may still become possible
 * in the future) was to always use OPFS for caching instead of this dual
 * implementation, however currently [Safari does not support writing to OPFS
 * outside of web
 * workers](https://webkit.org/blog/12257/the-file-system-access-api-with-origin-private-file-system/)
 * ([the WebKit bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231706)), so it's
 * not trivial to use this as a full on replacement of the Web Cache in the
 * browser. So for now we go with this split implementation.

/**
 * [Note: ArrayBuffer vs Blob vs Uint8Array]
 *
 * ArrayBuffers are in memory, while blobs are unreified, and can directly point
 * to on disk objects too.
 *
 * If we are just passing data around without necessarily needing to manipulate
 * it, and we already have a blob, it's best to just pass that blob. Further,
 * blobs also retains the file's encoding information , and are thus a layer
 * above array buffers which are just raw byte sequences.
 *
 * ArrayBuffers are not directly manipulatable, which is where some sort of a
 * typed array or a data view comes into the picture. The typed `Uint8Array` is
 * a common way.
 *
 * To convert from ArrayBuffer to Uint8Array,
 *
 *     new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer)
 *
 * Blobs are immutable, but a usual scenario is storing an entire file in a
 * blob, and when the need comes to display it, we can obtain a URL for it using
 *
 *     URL.createObjectURL(blob)
 *
 * Also note that a File is a Blob!
 *
 * To convert from a Blob to ArrayBuffer
 *
 *     await blob.arrayBuffer()
 *
 * To convert from a Blob to Uint8Array, chain the two steps
 *
 *     new Uint8Array(await blob.arrayBuffer())
 *
 * To convert from an ArrayBuffer or Uint8Array to Blob
 *
 *     new Blob([arrayBuffer, andOrAnyArray, andOrstring])
 *
 * To convert from a Uint8Array/ArrayBuffer/Blob to a ReadableStream
 *
 *     new Response(array).body
 *        OR
 *     new Blob([...]).stream()
 *
 * To convert from a stream to a string (or JSON)
 *
 *     await new Response(stream).text()
 *     await new Response(stream).json()
