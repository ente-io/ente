/**
 * @file Higher level functions that use the ontology of Ente's requirements.
 *
 * For more detailed documentation of specific functions, see the corresponding
 * function in `libsodium.ts`.
 *
 * [Note: Crypto code hierarchy]
 *
 * 1.  @/base/crypto            (Crypto API for our code)
 * 2.  @/base/crypto/libsodium  (Lower level wrappers over libsodium)
 * 3.  libsodium-wrappers       (JavaScript bindings to libsodium)
 *
 * Our cryptography primitives are provided by libsodium, specifically, its
 * JavaScript bindings ("libsodium-wrappers"). This is the lowest layer. Note
 * that we use the sumo variant, "libsodium-wrappers-sumo", since the standard
 * variant does not provide the `crypto_pwhash_*` functions.
 *
 * Direct usage of "libsodium-wrappers" is restricted to `crypto/libsodium.ts`.
 * This is the next higher layer. Usually the functions in this file are thin
 * wrappers over the raw libsodium APIs, with a bit of massaging. They also
 * ensure that sodium.ready has been called before accessing libsodium's APIs,
 * thus all the functions it exposes are async.
 *
 * The highest layer is this file, `crypto/index.ts`. These are usually simple
 * compositions of functionality exposed by `crypto/libsodium.ts`, the primary
 * difference being that these functions try to talk in terms of higher-level
 * Ente specific goal we are trying to accomplish instead of the specific
 * underlying crypto algorithms.
 *
 * There is an additional actor in play. Cryptographic operations like
 * encryption are CPU intensive and would cause the UI to stutter if used
 * directly on the main thread. To keep the UI smooth, we instead want to run
 * them in a web worker. However, sometimes we already _are_ running in a web
 * worker, and delegating to another worker is wasteful.
 *
 * To handle both these scenario, the potentially CPU intensive functions in
 * this file are split into the external API, and the underlying implementation
 * (denoted by an "_" prefix). To avoid a circular dependency during webpack
 * imports, we need to keep the implementation functions in a separate file
 * (`ente-impl.ts`).
 *
 * The external API functions check to see if we're already in a web worker, and
 * if so directly invoke the implementation. Otherwise the call the sibling
 * function in a shared "crypto" web worker (which then invokes the
 * implementation function, but this time in the context of a web worker).
 *
 * Also, some code (e.g. the uploader) creates it own crypto worker instances,
 * and thus directly calls the functions in the web worker (it created) instead
 * of going through this file.
