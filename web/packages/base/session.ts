 * called "intermediate") KEK using parameters suitable for interactive usage.
 * This KEK is not saved to remote, it is only maintained locally.
 *
 * In either case, eventually we want the encrypted key to be available in the
 * session for decrypting the user's files etc. In the web case, the page where
 * the user reenters their password will put it there, while on desktop
