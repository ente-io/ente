/**
 * Key value store schema.
 *
 * The use IndexedDB to store arbitrary key-value pairs. The functional
 * motivation is to allow these to also be accessed from web workers (local
 * storage is limited to the main thread).
 *
 * The "kv" database consists of one object store, "kv". Keys are strings.
 * Values can be arbitrary JSON objects.
 *
 * [Note: Avoiding IndexedDB flakiness by avoiding indexes]
 *
 * Sporadically, rarely, but definitely, we ran into issues with IndexedDB
 * losing data. e.g. saves from the ML web worker would complete successfully,
 * but the saves would not reflect on the main thread, and that data would just
 * get lost when the app would refresh.
 *
 * I'm not sure where the problem lay - in our own code, in the library that we
 * are using (idb), within IndexedDB itself, or in Electron/Chrome's
 * implementation of it (these cases all came up in the context of the ML code
 * that only ran in our desktop app).
 *
 * A piece of advice I randomly ran across on the internet was to keep it very
 * simple, and avoid all indexes. I also recalled that we did not see such
 * issues with our older (but now unmaintained) library, localforage, which also
 * doesn't use any indexes, and just has a flat single-store schema.
 *
 * So this may be superstition, but for now the approach I'm taking is to use
 * IndexedDB as a key value store only.

 * A lazily-created, cached promise for KV DB.

 * [Note: Caching IDB instances in separate execution contexts]

 * We open the database once (on access), and thereafter save and reuse this
 * promise each time something wants to connect to it.
 *
 * This promise can subsequently get cleared if we need to relinquish our
 * connection (e.g. if another client wants to open the face DB with a newer
 * version of the schema).
 *
 * It can also get cleared on logout. In all such cases, it'll automatically get
 * recreated on next access.
 *
 * Note that this is module specific state, so each execution context (main
 * thread, web worker) that calls the functions in this module will its own
 * promise to the database. To ensure that all connections get torn down
 * correctly, we need to perform the following logout sequence:
 *
 * 1. Terminate all the workers which might have one of the instances in memory.
 *    This closes their connections.
 *
 * 2. Delete the database on the main thread.
