/**
 * The local storage data about the user before login or signup is complete.
 *
 * [Note: Partial local user]
 *
 * During login or signup, the user object exists in various partial states in
 * local storage.
 *
 * - Initially, there is no user object in local storage.
 *
 * - When the user enters their email, the email property of the stored object
 *   is set, but nothing else.
 *
 * - After they verify their password, we have two cases: if second factor
 *   verification is not set, and when it is set.
 *
 * - If second factor verification is not set, then after verifying their
 *   password their {@link id} and {@link encryptedToken} will get filled in,
 *   and {@link isTwoFactorEnabled} will be set to false.
 *
 * - If they have second factor verification set, then after verifying their
 *   password {@link isTwoFactorEnabled} and {@link twoFactorSessionID} will
 *   also get filled in. Once they verify their TOTP based second factor, their
 *   {@link id} and {@link encryptedToken} will also get filled in.
 *
 * - If they have a passkey set as a second factor set, then after verifying
 *   their password the {@link passkeySessionID} will be set.
 *
 * - As the login or signup sequence completes, a {@link token} obtained from
 *   the {@link encryptedToken} will be written out, and the
 *   {@link encryptedToken} cleared since it is not needed anymore.
 *
 * So while the underlying storage is the same, we offer two APIs for code to
 * obtain the user:
 *
 * - Before login is complete, or when it is unknown if login is complete or
 *   not, then {@link savedPartialLocalUser} can be used to obtain a
 *   {@link PartialLocalUser} with all of its properties set to be optional (and
 *   some additional properties not available in the regular user object).
 *
 * - When we know that the login has completed, we can use either
 *   {@link savedLocalUser} (which returns `undefined` if our assumption is
 *   false) or {@link ensureSavedLocalUser} (which throws if our assumption is
 *   false) to obtain an object with all the properties expected to be present
 *   for a locally persisted user set to be required.
