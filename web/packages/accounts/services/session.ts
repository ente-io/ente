/**
 * Check if the local token and/or key attributes we have are still valid.
 *
 * This function does not take any parameters because it reads the current state
 * (key attributes) from local storage.
 *
 * @returns
 *
 * - status "invalid" if the current token has been invalidated,
 * - status "valid" normally
 * - status "validButPasswordChanged" we detected that user changed their
 *   password on a different device (without choosing the option to log out of
 *   all existing sessions).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * [Note: Handling password changes]
 *
 * If the user changes their password on a different device, then we need to
 * update our local state so that we use the latest password for verification.
 *
 * There is a straightforward way of doing this by always making a blocking API
 * call before showing the password unlock page, however that would add latency
 * to the 99% user experience (of normal unlocks) for the 1% case (they've
 * changed their password elsewhere).
 *
 * The approach we instead use is to make an non-blocking `/session-validity`
 * API call when this page is loaded. Usually this'll complete well before the
 * password enters their password and presses "Sign in", but we also
 * transparently await for this API call to finish before initiating the actual
 * verification. Thus there is no extra latency in the happy paths.
 *
 * The `/session-validity` API call tells us:
 *
 * 1. Whether or not the session has been invalidated (by the user choosing to
 *    log out from all devices elsewhere).
 *
 * 2. What are their latest key attributes.
 *
 * If the session has been invalidated, we log them out here too.
 *
 * If the key attributes we get are different from the ones we have locally, we
 * regenerate new ones locally, and then use those for verifying the password
 * subsequently.
