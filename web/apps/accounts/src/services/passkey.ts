    // The server returns a JSON containing a "sessionID" (to tie together the
    // beginning and the end of the registration), and "options" that we should
    // pass on to the browser when asking it to create credentials.
    //
    // However, some massaging needs to be done first. On the backend, we use
    // the [go-webauthn](https://github.com/go-webauthn/webauthn) library to
    // begin the registration ceremony, and we verbatim credential creation
    // options that the library returns to us. These are meant to plug directly
    // into `CredentialCreationOptions` that `navigator.credential.create`
    // expects. Specifically, since we're creating a public key credential, the
    // `publicKey` attribute of the returned options will be in the shape of the
    // `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` expected by the browser). Except,
    // binary data.
    //
    // Binary data in the returned `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions` are
    // serialized as a "URLEncodedBase64", which is a URL-encoded base64 string
    // without any padding. The library is following the WebAuthn recommendation
    // when it does this:
    //
    // > The term "Base64url Encoding refers" to the base64 encoding using the
    // > URL- and filename-safe character set defined in Section 5 of RFC4648,
    // > which all trailing '=' characters omitted (as permitted by Section 3.2)
    // >
    // > https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/#base64url-encoding
    //
    // However, the browser expects binary data as an "ArrayBuffer, TypedArray
    // or DataView".
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions
    //
    // So we do the conversion here.
    //
    // 1.  To avoid inventing an intermediary type and the boilerplate that'd
    //     come with it, we do a force typecast the options in the response to
    //     one that has `PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions`.
    //
    // 2.  Convert the two binary data fields that are expected to be in the
    //     response from URLEncodedBase64 strings to Uint8Arrays. There is a
    //     third possibility, excludedCredentials[].id, but that we don't
    //     currently use.
    //
    // The web.dev guide calls this out too:
    //
    // > ArrayBuffer values transferred from the server such as `challenge`,
    // > `user.id` and credential `id` for `excludeCredentials` need to be
    // > encoded on transmission. Don't forget to decode them on the frontend
    // > before passing to the WebAuthn API call. We recommend using Base64URL
    // > encode.
    // >
    // > https://web.dev/articles/passkey-registration
    //
    // So that's that. But to further complicate things, the libdom.ts typings
    // included with the current TypeScript version (5.4) indicate these binary
    // types as a:
    //
    //     type BufferSource = ArrayBufferView | ArrayBuffer
    //
    // However MDN documentation states that they can be TypedArrays (e.g.
    // Uint8Arrays), and using Uint8Arrays works in practice too. So another
    // force cast is needed.
    //
    // ----
    //
    // Finally, the same process needs to happen, in reverse, when we're sending
    // the browser's response to credential creation to our backend for storing
    // that credential (for future authentication). Binary fields need to be
    // converted to URL-safe B64 before transmission.
