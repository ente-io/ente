# Storage

## Session Storage

Data tied to the browser tab's lifetime.

The primary information store in session storage is the user's encryption key
here. In addition, various other transient bits and bobs are also kept here.

## Local Storage

Data in the local storage is persisted even after the user closes the tab, or
the browser itself. This is in contrast with session storage, where the data is
cleared when the browser tab is closed.

The data in local storage is tied to the Document's origin (scheme + host).

Some things that get stored here are:

- Details about the logged in user, in particular their user id and a auth token
  we can use to make API calls on their behalf.

- Various user preferences

## IndexedDB

IndexedDB is a transactional NoSQL store provided by browsers. It has quite
large storage limits, and data is stored per origin (and remains persistent
across tab restarts).

Unlike local storage, IndexedDB is also accessible from web workers and so we
also use IndexedDB for storing ad-hoc key value pairs.

Older code used the LocalForage library for storing things in Indexed DB. This
library falls back to localStorage in case Indexed DB storage is not available.

Newer code uses the idb library which provides a promise API over the IndexedDB,
but otherwise does not introduce any new abstractions.

## OPFS

OPFS is used for caching entire files when we're running under Electron (the Web
Cache API is used in the browser).

As it name suggests, it is an entire file system, private for us ("origin"). In
is not undbounded though, and the storage is not guaranteed to be persistent (at
least with the APIs we use), hence the cache designation.
