ente's Authenticator app helps you generate and store 2 step verification (2FA) tokens on your mobile devices.


FEATURES

- Secure Backups
ente provides end-to-end encrypted cloud backups so that you don't have to worry about losing your tokens. We use the same protocols Ente Photos uses to encrypt and preserve your data.

- Multi Device Synchronization
ente will automatically sync the 2FA tokens you add to your account, across all your devices. Every new device you sign into will have access to these tokens.

- Web access
You can access your 2FA code from any web browser by visiting https://auth.ente.io .

- Offline Mode
ente generates 2FA tokens offline, so your network connectivity will not get in the way of your workflow.

- Import and Export Tokens
You can add tokens to ente by one of the following methods: 
1. Scanning a QR code
2. Manually entering (copy-pasting) a 2FA secret
3. Bulk importing from a file that contains a list of codes in the following format:

otpauth://totp/provider.com:you@email.com?secret=YOUR_SECRET

The codes maybe separated by new lines or commas.

You can also export the codes you have added to ente, to an **unencrypted** text file, that adheres to the above format.
