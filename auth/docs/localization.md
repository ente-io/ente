## Localization

If the feature requires adding new strings, you can do that by following these
steps:

1. Add a new entry inside
   [app_en.arb](https://github.com/ente-io/ente/blob/main/auth/lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb)
   (remember to save!)

2.  In your dart file, add the following import

    ```dart
    import "package:ente_auth/l10n/l10n.dart";
    ```

3. Refer to the string using `context.l10n.<keyName>`. For example

    ```dart
    context.l10n.account
    ```
