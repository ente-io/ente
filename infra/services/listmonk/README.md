# Listmonk

We use [Listmonk](https://listmonk.app/) to manage our mailing lists.

- Museum lets Listmonk know about new users and account deletion (this allows
  Listmonk to create corresponding accounts).

- Subsequently, Listmonk handles user subscription / unsubscription etc
  (Listmonk stores its data in an external Postgres).

## Installing

Install [nginx](../nginx/README.md).

Add Listmonk's configuration.

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /root/listmonk
sudo tee /root/listmonk/config.toml
```

Add the service definition and nginx configuration.

```sh
scp services/listmonk/listmonk.* <instance>:

sudo mv listmonk.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo mv listmonk.nginx.conf /root/nginx/conf.d
```

> The very first time we ran Listmonk, at this point we also needed to get it to
> install the tables it needs in the Postgres DB. For this, we used the
> `initialize-db.sh` script.
>
> ```sh
> scp services/listmonk/initialize-db.sh <instance>:
>
> sudo sh initialize-db.sh
> rm initialize-db.sh

Tell systemd to pick up new service definitions, enable the unit (so that it
automatically starts on boot), and start it this time around.

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now listmonk
```

Tell nginx to pick up the new configuration.

```sh
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```
