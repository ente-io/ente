## Staff dashboard

Web app for staff members to help with support and other administration.

### Development

Use `yarn dev` to run a local dev server with hot reload.

> [!TIP]
>
> See [web/docs/new.md](../../web/docs/new.md) for help in setting up your
> editor to do the formatting and linting. You can also run the formatter and
> linter manually using `yarn lint`, and `yarn lint-fix` to fix them. These
> commands automatically run on every PR.

### Deployment

The app gets redeployed whenever a PR is merged into main. See
[web/docs/deploy.md](../../web/docs/deploy.md) for more details.
