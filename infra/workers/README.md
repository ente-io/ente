# Cloudflare Workers

Source code for our
[Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/).

Workers are organized as Yarn workspaces sharing a common `package.json` and
base `tsconfig`. They can however be deployed individually.

## Deploying

Install dependencies with `yarn`.

> If you have previously deployed, then you will have an old `yarn.lock`. In
> this case it is safe to delete and recreate using `rm yarn.lock && yarn`.

Then, to deploy an individual worker

- Login into wrangler (if needed) using
  `yarn workspace health-check wrangler login`

- Deploy! `yarn workspace health-check wrangler deploy`

Wrangler is the CLI provided by Cloudflare to manage workers. Apart from
deploying, it also allows us to stream logs from running workers by using
`yarn workspace <worker-name> wrangler tail`.

## Creating a new worker

Copy paste an existing one. Unironically this is a good option because
Cloudflare's template has a lot of unnecessary noise, but if really do want to
create one from scratch, use `npm create cloudflare@latest`.

To import an existing worker from the Cloudflare dashboard, use

```sh
npm create cloudflare@2 existing-worker-name -- --type pre-existing --existing-script existing-worker-name
```

## Logging

Attach the tail worker to your worker by adding

    tail_consumers = [{ service = "tail" }]

in its `wrangler.toml`. Then any `console.(log|warn|error)` statements and
uncaught exceptions in your worker will be logged to Grafana.
