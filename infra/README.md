# Infra

Various knick-knacks that we use when hosting our servers.

These are not needed for running Ente's server or for self-hosting, these are
just additional services we run to make our infrastructure more robust. As such,
it's unlikely that you'll find the pieces here directly useful for your needs,
but feel free to have a look around if you're curious!
