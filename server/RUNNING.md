# Running Museum

You can run a Docker compose cluster containing museum, the web app, and the
essential auxiliary services it requires (database and object storage). This is
the easiest and simplest way to get started, and also provides an isolated
environment that doesn't clutter your machine.

You can also run museum directly on your machine if you wish - it is a single
static go binary.

This document describes these different approaches (you can choose any one), and
also outlines configuration.

-   [Run using pre-built Docker images](quickstart/README.md)
-   [Run using Docker, building image from source](#build-and-run-using-docker)
-   [Run with Docker, à la carte](#pre-built-images)
-   [Run without Docker](#running-without-docker)
-   [Configuration](#configuration)

## Run using pre-built Docker images

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ente-io/ente/main/server/quickstart.sh)"
```

For more details, see [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md).

## Build and run using Docker

Start the cluster (in the `ente/server` directory)

    docker compose up --build

Once the cluster has started, you should be able to do call museum

    curl http://localhost:8080/ping

Or connect from the [web app](../web)

    NEXT_PUBLIC_ENTE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080 yarn dev

Or connect from the [mobile app](../mobile)

    flutter run --dart-define=endpoint=http://localhost:8080

Or interact with the other services in the cluster, e.g. connect to the DB

    docker compose exec postgres env PGPASSWORD=pgpass psql -U pguser -d ente_db

Or interact with the MinIO S3 API

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=changeme AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=changeme1234 \
        aws s3 --endpoint-url http://localhost:3200 ls s3://b2-eu-cen

Or open the MinIO dashboard at http://localhost:3201

> [!NOTE]
>
> To avoid exposing unnecessary services, this port is not exposed by default.
> You'll need to uncomment the corresponding port in your `compose.yaml` first.

> [!WARNING]
>
> The default credentials are user changeme / password changeme1234. Goes
> without saying, but remember to change them!

> [!NOTE]
>
> While we've provided a MinIO based Docker compose file to make it easy for
> people to get started, if you're running it in production we recommend using
> an external S3.

### Cleanup

Persistent data is stored in Docker volumes and will persist across container
restarts. The volume can be saved / inspected using the `docker volumes`
command.

To remove stopped containers, use `docker compose rm`. To also remove volumes,
use `docker compose down -v`.

### Multiple clusters

You can spin up independent clusters, each with its own volumes, by using the
`-p` Docker Compose flag to specify different project names for each one.

### Pruning images

Each time museum gets rebuilt from source, a new image gets created but the old
one is retained as a dangling image. You can use `docker image prune --force`,
or `docker system prune` if that's fine with you, to remove these.

## Pre-built images

## server

If you have setup the database and object storage externally and only want to
run Ente's server, you can just pull and run the image from
**`ghcr.io/ente-io/server`**.

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/ente-io/server
```

## web

Similarly, there is a pre-built Docker image containing all the web apps which
you can just pull and run the from **`ghcr.io/ente-io/web`**.

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/ente-io/web
```

For details about configuring the web image, see
[web/docs/docker.md](../web/docs/docker.md).

## Running without Docker

The museum binary can be run by using `go run cmd/museum/main.go`. But first,
you'll need to prepare your machine for development. Here we give the steps,
with examples that work for macOS (please adapt to your OS).

### Install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

```sh
brew install go
```

### Install Postgres

```sh
brew install postgresql@15
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Here we install same major version of Postgres as our production database to
> avoid surprises, but if you're using a newer Postgres that should work fine
> too.

Run the service:

```sh
brew services run postgresql@15
```

> [!TIP]
>
> To stop, use
>
> ```sh
> brew services stop postgresql@15
> ```
>
> You can also tell brew to automatically start the service on login by using `start` instead of `run`
>
> ```sh
> brew services start postgresql@15
> ```

Create the database and user (one time)

```sh
psql postgres -c "CREATE USER pguser WITH PASSWORD 'pgpass';"
psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE ente_db OWNER pguser;"
```

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Since these are dev instructions, we're using the default username and password. For any non-trivial use, change the credentials.

> [!TIP]
>
> To inspect the DB, you can
>
> ```sh
> psql ente_db
> ```
>
> Data is stored in `/opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@15`

### Install Local S3

If you don't have a test S3 bucket, you can run a S3 compatible API locally. This section outlines using minio. Garage is also a newer alternative.

```sh
brew install minio minio-mc
brew services run minio
```

One time bucket creation.

```sh
mc alias set local http://127.0.0.1:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
mc mb local/b2-eu-cen
mc ls local
```

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Since these are dev instructions, we're using the default username and password. For any non-trivial use, change the credentials.

### Create config

Create `museum.yaml` in `ente/server`.

```yaml
db:
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    name: ente_db
    user: pguser
    password: pgpass

s3:
    are_local_buckets: true
    b2-eu-cen:
        key: minioadmin
        secret: minioadmin
        endpoint: localhost:9000
        region: eu-central-2
        bucket: b2-eu-cen
```

### Start museum

From `ente/server`,

```sh
go run cmd/museum/main.go
```

For live reloads, install [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air#installation).
Then you can just call `air` after declaring the required environment variables.
For example,

```sh
air
```

### Testing

Set up a local database for testing. This is not required for running the server.
Create a test database with the following name and credentials:

```sql
$ psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE ente_test_db;
CREATE USER test_user WITH PASSWORD 'test_pass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ente_test_db TO test_user;
```

For running the tests, you can use the following command:

```sh
ENV="test" go test -v ./pkg/...
go clean -testcache  && ENV="test" go test -v ./pkg/...
```

To run the full `server/` Go test suite inside Docker instead of relying on a
host Postgres setup, use:

```sh
./scripts/test-in-docker.sh
./scripts/test-in-docker.sh -v
```

## Configuration

Now that you have museum running (either inside Docker or standalone), we can
talk about configuring it.

By default, museum runs in the "local" configuration using values specified in
`local.yaml`.

To override these values, you can create a file named `museum.yaml` in the
current directory. This path is git-ignored for convenience. Note that if you
run the Docker compose cluster without creating this file, Docker will create an
empty directory named `museum.yaml` which you can `rmdir` if you need to provide
a config file later on.

The keys and values supported by this configuration file are documented in
[configurations/local.yaml](configurations/local.yaml).
