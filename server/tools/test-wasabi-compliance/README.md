Run through the process of using [Wasabi's compliance
feature](https://wasabi.com/wp-content/themes/wasabi/docs/API_Guide/index.html#t=topics%2FCompliance.htm&rhsyns=%20)
to ensure that it does indeed behave the way we expect it to.

Also acts as a test for the code in `pkg/external/wasabi`.

## What does it do?

The command runs through the two checklist:

* First checklist is for enabling compliance on the bucket, adding a new object,
  and then disabling the conditional hold on that object (See `Sequence 1` for
  the full sequence that'll be run through).

* Second checklist is for deleting the object. This checklist can be executed by
  running the command with the `--only-delete` flag (See `Sequence 2` for the
  full sequence).

Since the minimum retention duration is 1 day, these two checklists need to be
manually run through after the requisite gap.

## Running

Use the `--profile` flag (or set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable) to
specify which AWS config and credentials to use:

    go run tools/test-wasabi-compliance/main.go --profile my-test-profile

For more details about how to profiles work, or alternative ways to provide
credentials, see the documentation for `ParseAndCreateSession`.
