# Configuring museum
# ------------------
#
# 1. If the environment variable `ENVIRONMENT` is specified, then it is used to
#    load one of the files from the `configurations/` directory. If not present,
#    then by default `local.yaml` (this file) will get loaded.
#
# 2. If the "credentials-file" config option is set then museum will look for
#    that file. If found, that file will also be loaded, and entries specified
#    therein will override the defaults specified here.
#
# 3. Then, museum will look for a file named `museum.yaml` (gitignored) in the
#    current working directory. If found, this file will also be loaded and
#    merged.
#
# 4. Config can be overridden with via environment variables (details below).
#
# Environment variables
# ---------------------
#
# All configuration options can be overridden via environment variables. The
# environment variable should have the prefix "ENTE_", and any nesting should be
# replaced by underscores.
#
# For example, the nested string "db.user" in the config file can alternatively
# be specified (or be overridden) by setting an environment variable named
# ENTE_DB_USER.
#
# Hyphens "-" will also be be replaced with underscores, so a string like "s3.b2-eu-cen"
# can be specified by the environment variable named "S3_B2_EU_CEN".
#
#
# Empty strings
# -------------
#
# The empty string indicates missing values (to match go convention).
#
# This also means that to override a value that is specified in local.yaml in a
# subsequently loaded config file, you should specify the key as an empty string
# (`key: ""`) instead of leaving it unset.
#
# ---

# If this option is specified, then it is loaded and gets merged-in over the
# defaults present in default.yaml. This provides a way to inject credentials
# and other overrides.
#
# The default is to look for a file named credentials.yaml in the CWD.
#credentials-file: credentials.yaml

# Some credentials (e.g. the TLS cert) are cumbersome to provide inline in the
# YAML configuration file, thus these are loaded at runtime from separate files.
#
# This is the directory where museum should look for them.
#
# Currently, the following files are loaded (if needed)
#
# - credentials/{tls.cert,tls.key}
# - credentials/pst-service-account.json
# - credentials/fcm-service-account.json
#
# The default is to look for a these files in a directory named credentials
# under the CWD.
#credentials-dir: credentials

# By default, museum logs to stdout when running locally. Specify this path to
# get it to log to a file instead.
#
# It must be specified if running in a non-local environment.
