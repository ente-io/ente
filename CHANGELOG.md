# CHANGELOG


## v0.7.118

### Added
* #### Explore with the new Search Tab ✨

    Introducing a dedicated search tab with distinct sections for effortless discovery.

    You can now discover items that come under different Locations, Moments, Contacts, Photo descriptions, Albums and File types with ease.

* #### Black Friday Sale 🎉

    You can now purchase Ente's plans for 3 years at 30% off and 5 years at 50% off.

    The storage you purchase will be stacked on top of your current plan.

    This is the lowest our prices will ever be, so do consider upgrading!


## v0.7.82

### Added
* #### Hidden albums

    You can now hide albums, just like individual memories.

* #### Album improvements

    You can now pin your favourite albums, and set cover photos for them.

    We have also added a way to first create empty albums, and then add photos to it, both from ente and your device gallery.


* #### Email verification

    We have now made email verification optional, so you can sign in with just your email address and password, without waiting for a verification code.

    You can opt in / out of email verification from Settings > Security.


* #### Bug fixes & other enhancements

    We have squashed a few pesky bugs that were reported by our community, and have improved the experience for albums and quick links.
