* Collaborative albums âœ¨

You can now create albums where multiple ente users can add photos!

Albums can have both collaborators and viewers, and as many as you like. Storage is only counted once, for the person who uploaded the photo

This will enable many aspects of partner sharing

* Support for uncategorized photos - keep photos that do not belong to albums. This also allows you to delete albums whilst keeping their contents

* Redesigned album selector
