Ente is a simple app to automatically backup and organize your photos and videos.

If you've been looking for a privacy-friendly alternative to preserve your memories, you've come to the right place. With Ente, they are stored end-to-end encrypted (e2ee). This means that only you can view them.

We have apps across Android, iOS, web and Desktop, and your photos will seamlessly sync between all your devices in an end-to-end encrypted (e2ee) manner.

Ente also makes it simple to share your albums with your loved ones. You can either share them directly with other Ente users, end-to-end encrypted; or with publicly viewable links.

Your encrypted data is stored across multiple locations, including a fall-out shelter in Paris. We take posterity seriously and make it easy to ensure that your memories outlive you.
