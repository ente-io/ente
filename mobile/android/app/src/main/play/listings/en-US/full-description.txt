Ente is a simple app to backup and share your photos and videos.

If you've been looking for a privacy-friendly alternative to Google Photos, you've come to the right place. With Ente, they are stored end-to-end encrypted (e2ee). This means that only you can view them.

We have open-source apps across Android, iOS, web and desktop, and your photos will seamlessly sync between all of them in an end-to-end encrypted (e2ee) manner.

Ente also makes it simple to share your albums with your loved ones, even if they aren't on Ente. You can share publicly viewable links, where they can view your album and collaborate by adding photos to it, even without an account or app.

Your encrypted data is replicated to 3 different locations, including a fall-out shelter in Paris. We take posterity seriously and make it easy to ensure that your memories outlive you.

We are here to make the safest photos app ever, come join our journey!
