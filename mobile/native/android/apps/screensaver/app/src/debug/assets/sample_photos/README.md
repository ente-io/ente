These images are intended for **development/testing only**.

This folder contains a small set of sample photos checked into the repo for debug builds.

For format compatibility checks, create local test copies (do not commit) that cover:
- jpg/jpeg/png/bmp/webp
- gif/svg
- apng/avif/jxl
- heic/heif
- dng/orf/nef/arw/rw2/cr2/cr3

When validating, watch slideshow diagnostics and confirm each sample renders without repeated failure loops.

If you plan to redistribute images (e.g., in a public release build), review licensing and consider replacing them with your own test assets.
