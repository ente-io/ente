# Photo Swipe Culling - Implementation Progress

## Implementation Tasks

### Setup & Navigation
- [ ] Create new directory structure: `lib/ui/pages/library_culling/`
- [ ] Create `swipe_culling_page.dart` with basic StatefulWidget scaffold
- [ ] Add navigation from Similar Images page (carousel icon in AppBar)
- [ ] Pass `List<SimilarFiles>` data via constructor

### Core UI Components
- [ ] Install flutter_card_swiper package (version ^7.0.1)
- [ ] Implement main swipe card UI with CardSwiper widget
- [ ] Create top carousel for group preview (PageView)
- [ ] Add progress indicator (current/total groups)
- [ ] Implement swipe overlay colors (red for delete, green for keep)

### State Management
- [ ] Set up state variables (currentGroupIndex, decisions map, etc.)
- [ ] Implement swipe handlers (onSwipe callback)
- [ ] Track decisions per image within current group
- [ ] Handle group progression logic

### Auto-advance Flow
- [ ] Implement progress ring animation (2-second timer)
- [ ] Add subtle scale animation for celebration
- [ ] Create smooth transition to next group
- [ ] Handle manual skip during auto-advance

### User Controls
- [ ] Add undo button functionality (within current group only)
- [ ] Implement group summary popup (grid view with overlay indicators)
- [ ] Add delete confirmation dialog
- [ ] Create completion screen for final group

### Business Logic
- [ ] Duplicate `_deleteFilesLogic` from similar_images_page.dart
- [ ] Filter out single-image and 50+ image groups
- [ ] Implement best picture selection (use first image)
- [ ] Handle symlink creation for album preservation

### Polish & Edge Cases
- [ ] Add loading states during deletion
- [ ] Handle empty state (no valid groups)
- [ ] Implement smooth animations throughout
- [ ] Add haptic feedback for swipe actions

### Localization
- [ ] Add all new strings to `intl_en.arb`:
  - swipeCulling
  - swipeToCull
  - keepPhoto
  - deletePhoto
  - undoLastDecision
  - skipGroup
  - viewSummary
  - confirmDeletion
  - deletingPhotos
  - cullingComplete
  - photosDeleted
  - noSimilarPhotosFound

### Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Test with various group sizes (2-50 images)
- [ ] Verify deletion logic and symlink creation
- [ ] Ensure smooth animations (60 FPS)
- [ ] Test undo functionality
- [ ] Verify completion flow
- [ ] Test edge cases (network issues, large groups)

## Notes
- Priority: Smooth animations and responsive swipe gestures
- No analytics or tracking code
- Use existing deletion logic from similar_images_page.dart
- Keep UI simple and focused on the swipe interaction
