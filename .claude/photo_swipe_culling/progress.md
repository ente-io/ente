# Photo Swipe Culling - Implementation Progress

## Implementation Tasks

### Setup & Navigation
- [x] Create new directory structure: `lib/ui/pages/library_culling/`
- [x] Create `swipe_culling_page.dart` with basic StatefulWidget scaffold
- [x] Add navigation from Similar Images page (carousel icon in AppBar)
- [x] Pass `List<SimilarFiles>` data via constructor

### Core UI Components
- [x] Install flutter_card_swiper package (version ^7.0.1)
- [x] Implement main swipe card UI with CardSwiper widget
- [x] Create top carousel for group preview (PageView)
- [x] Add progress indicator (current/total groups)
- [x] Implement swipe overlay colors (red for delete, green for keep)

### State Management
- [x] Set up state variables (currentGroupIndex, decisions map, etc.)
- [x] Implement swipe handlers (onSwipe callback)
- [x] Track decisions per image within current group
- [x] Handle group progression logic

### Auto-advance Flow
- [x] Implement progress ring animation (2-second timer)
- [x] Add subtle scale animation for celebration
- [x] Create smooth transition to next group
- [x] Handle manual skip during auto-advance

### User Controls
- [x] Add undo button functionality (within current group only)
- [x] Implement group summary popup (grid view with overlay indicators)
- [x] Add delete confirmation dialog
- [x] Create completion screen for final group

### Business Logic
- [x] Duplicate `_deleteFilesLogic` from similar_images_page.dart
- [x] Filter out single-image and 50+ image groups
- [x] Implement best picture selection (use first image)
- [x] Handle symlink creation for album preservation

### Polish & Edge Cases
- [x] Add loading states during deletion
- [x] Handle empty state (no valid groups)
- [x] Implement smooth animations throughout
- [x] Add haptic feedback for swipe actions

### Localization
- [x] Add all new strings to `intl_en.arb`:
  - swipeCulling
  - swipeToCull
  - keepPhoto
  - deletePhoto
  - undoLastDecision
  - skipGroup
  - viewSummary
  - confirmDeletion
  - deletingPhotos
  - cullingComplete
  - photosDeleted
  - noSimilarPhotosFound

### Bug Fixes & UI Improvements
- [ ] Fix carousel icon visibility - check filtered groups instead of selected files
- [ ] Fix swipe overlay - use colored border instead of full overlay
- [ ] Fix black screen bug after swiping (image loading issue)
- [ ] Fix image display:
  - [ ] Show full image without cropping (preserve aspect ratio)
  - [ ] Use full resolution images instead of thumbnails
  - [ ] Check zoomable_image.dart for proper image loading logic
- [ ] Redesign group carousel:
  - [ ] Current group: stacked thumbnails with rotation
  - [ ] Other groups: single thumbnail
  - [ ] Size difference between current and other groups
  - [ ] Opacity for non-selected groups instead of border
- [ ] Fix tap behavior: tap on current group shows summary
- [ ] Speed up completion animation (max 0.4s, no text)
- [ ] Replace "X of Y" with visual progress indicator
- [ ] Improve bottom buttons:
  - [ ] Add rounded container background
  - [ ] Move slightly up from bottom
  - [ ] Use circular arrow icon for undo

### Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Test with various group sizes (2-50 images)
- [ ] Verify deletion logic and symlink creation
- [ ] Ensure smooth animations (60 FPS)
- [ ] Test undo functionality
- [ ] Verify completion flow
- [ ] Test edge cases (network issues, large groups)

## Notes
- Priority: Smooth animations and responsive swipe gestures
- No analytics or tracking code
- Use existing deletion logic from similar_images_page.dart
- Keep UI simple and focused on the swipe interaction
