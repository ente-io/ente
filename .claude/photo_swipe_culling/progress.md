## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- **State Management**: StatefulWidget with setState
- **Package Used**: flutter_card_swiper ^7.0.1
- **Deletion**: Reuses existing `_deleteFilesLogic` with symlinks
- **Filtering**: Excludes single-image and 50+ image groups
- **Design System**: Follows Ente color scheme and patterns

### File Structure

```
lib/ui/pages/library_culling/
├── swipe_culling_page.dart        # Main page (~850 lines)
├── models/
│   └── swipe_culling_state.dart   # Data models
└── widgets/
    ├── swipeable_photo_card.dart  # Card with border feedback
    ├── group_carousel.dart        # Square thumbnails, badges
    └── group_summary_popup.dart   # Grid view, vertical buttons
```

### Key Features

- **Swipe Gestures**: Right = Keep, Left = Delete
- **Visual Feedback**: Colored borders that intensify with swipe distance
- **Group Navigation**: Tap to switch, long-press for summary
- **Progress Tracking**: Dots show decisions (red/green/gray)
- **Batch Processing**: Review all decisions before final deletion
- **Safety**: Symlinks preserve album associations

## Quality Assurance

- ✅ Flutter analyze: 0 issues in photos app
- ✅ All imports properly ordered
- ✅ No deprecated APIs used
- ✅ Proper null safety
- ✅ Consistent code style
- ✅ Localization complete

## Remaining improvements/fixes

- [x] Use circular undo icon as specified in feature plan
- [x] Double pressing the image in card should zoom in to image by pushing the `DetailPage` with hero animation (check `similar_images_page.dart` for example).
- [x] Stack next image behind current image with darkening/opacity, peeking from top. Shows full image preview that animates forward when current is swiped.
- [x] Fix issue with the carousel groups looking too dark. Even the selected group in carousel row looks darker than the current image, which is weird.
- [ ] Make the undo button animate nicely to the previous photo, instead of this flicker. Think hard on how to do this animation.
- [ ] Pressing the undo button when nothing is decided in current group should navigate the user to the last group with changes and undo a change there.
- [ ] Animate going from last image in group to first image in next group
- [ ] Bug: when only having a single group, finishing it, and then canceling the delete, the complete checkmark animation stays on screen. Which is fine, but it doesn't disappear on pressing the undo button.
- [ ] Better placement of the instagram-like progress dots

## Remaining Tasks (Optional)

- [ ] Production testing with various group sizes
- [ ] Performance monitoring with large datasets
- [ ] User feedback collection
- [ ] A/B testing for UX improvements

## Future Enhancements (v2)

- [ ] AI-powered "Best Picture" detection
- [ ] Decision persistence across sessions
- [ ] Batch operations ("Delete all except first")
- [ ] Advanced statistics dashboard
- [ ] Customizable swipe sensitivity
- [ ] Cloud backup of decisions
- [ ] Machine learning for quality detection

## Notes

- **Priority**: Smooth 60fps animations maintained
- **Security**: No analytics or tracking code
- **Privacy**: All processing done locally
- **E2E Encryption**: Fully preserved
- **Design**: Follows Ente design language throughout
